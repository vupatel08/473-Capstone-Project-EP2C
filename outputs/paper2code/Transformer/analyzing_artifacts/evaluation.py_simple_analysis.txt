Below is a detailed logic analysis for evaluation.py. This module’s purpose is to assess the trained Transformer model using beam search decoding and then reporting final metrics (BLEU for translation or F1 for parsing) in a structured format. The analysis strictly follows the paper’s evaluation protocols, the design’s module interfaces, and the configuration parameters provided in config.yaml.

─────────────────────────────  
Overview of Evaluation.py

• The Evaluation class will be instantiated with:
  – The trained TransformerModel (from model.py)
  – A data dictionary containing the evaluation (test) dataset (for translation or parsing)
  – A configuration dictionary (from config.yaml) that includes inference parameters (beam size, length penalty, and max output length settings specific to each task)

• The public interface consists of the __init__() and evaluate() methods. All other helper functions (e.g., for beam search) will be internal (private) to the class.

─────────────────────────────  
1. __init__ Method

• Inputs:
  – model: the TransformerModel instance
  – data: a dict that contains test data (could be structured with keys such as “translation” and “parsing” according to the experiment)
  – config: the overall configuration dictionary

• In __init__, the Evaluation class will:
  – Store the model, data, and configuration.
  – (Optionally) Determine which task is being evaluated by inspecting data and/or config (e.g., if config contains inference.translation settings, then the task is translation; else if using inference.parsing, then it is parsing).  
  – Extract relevant inference parameters from config:
    ○ For translation: beam_size (4), length_penalty (0.6) and max_output_length is computed as “input_length + 50.”
    ○ For parsing: beam_size (21), length_penalty (0.3) and max_output_length computed as “input_length + 300.”
  – Possibly set the model into evaluation mode (i.e. model.eval()) if not already set.

2. evaluate() Method

The evaluate() method is the main entry point, and it will perform the following steps:

A. Model Setup
  – Call model.eval() to disable dropout and other training-specific behavior.
  – Initialize empty lists to collect predictions and corresponding reference (gold) outputs.

B. Iterating Over the Test Dataset
  – For each batch in the test data:
    ○ For each source sample (and its corresponding reference), compute a source mask as required by the model.
    ○ Determine the maximum allowed output length:
      – For translation: max_length = (length of source sequence) + 50 (as specified in config.inference.translation.max_output_length)
      – For parsing: max_length = (length of input) + 300 (as specified in config.inference.parsing.max_output_length)
    ○ Using the _beam_search() helper (described below), generate a candidate prediction for the input. The beam search will use:
      – beam_size and length_penalty drawn from config (depending on the task)
      – Early termination if the model predicts the end-of-sequence token (EOS) before reaching max_length.
    ○ Convert the predicted token indices into text using the same vocabulary/tokenizer that was used during data preprocessing.
    ○ Append the decoded prediction and the reference text (already tokenized or converted to text) to their respective lists.

C. Metric Computation
  – After processing all test batches, the evaluation method decides which metric to compute.
    ○ For Translation Tasks:
      – Invoke sacreBLEU (e.g., sacrebleu.corpus_bleu(predictions, [references])) to compute the BLEU score.
    ○ For Constituency Parsing Tasks:
      – Use an F1 computation routine. (Since F1 scoring for parsing may require additional tree comparison logic, the evaluation module can either call an external utility or wrap a function that computes F1 by comparing predicted constituency trees with the gold trees.)
  – Construct a results dictionary containing the key metric(s). For example:
    { "task": "translation", "BLEU": computed_bleu }
    or { "task": "parsing", "F1": computed_f1 }

D. Reporting Results
  – Optionally, print/log the metrics to console.
  – Return the results dictionary.

3. Beam Search Decoding (Internal Helper Function: _beam_search)

The Evaluation class will include an internal helper method (e.g., _beam_search) that implements the following logic:

A. Initialization
  – For a given source input (a Tensor), first compute the corresponding source mask.
  – Run the encoder portion of the model to obtain encoded source features.
  – Initialize the beam with the start-of-sequence (BOS) token for each candidate (usually a list with one element containing the BOS token index and an initial score of 0).

B. Iterative Decoding Loop
  – For each time step up to the maximum output length:
    ○ For each candidate in the beam:
      – Construct the partial target sequence.
      – Compute the target mask (which also applies causal masking for auto-regressive decoding).
      – Call model.forward(src, tgt, src_mask, tgt_mask) to compute the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token.
    ○ Extend each beam candidate with every possible next token and update the cumulative log-probability scores.
    ○ Apply the length penalty (using the configured value: 0.6 for translation or 0.3 for parsing) when scoring and selecting new beam candidates.
    ○ Prune the candidate list so that only the top “beam_size” candidates remain.
    ○ If any candidate predicts the end-of-sequence token and meets any early termination criteria, mark that beam candidate as complete.
  – The loop terminates when all beam candidates have reached EOS or the maximum output length is reached.

C. Return the Best Candidate
  – From the completed candidates, select the one with the best (highest) overall score.
  – Return the predicted token sequence (which will be decoded later into a human-readable string).

Note: Although the beam search algorithm described above is iterative and can be computationally intensive, it follows the paper’s inference protocol and ensures that the model’s auto-regressive property is maintained through proper masking.

4. Handling Different Tasks (Translation vs. Parsing)

• The evaluation module must check the configuration to know whether it is processing a translation or parsing experiment:
  – For translation:
    ○ Use parameters from config.inference.translation.
    ○ Report the BLEU metric.
  – For parsing:
   ○ Use parameters from config.inference.parsing.
     ▪ Beam search uses a larger beam size (21) and a higher max output length (input_length + 300).
   ○ Compute F1 metric over constituency structures.
• This decision can be made earlier in evaluate() based on keys in config or the structure of the provided data.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Integration with Shared Utilities

• The Evaluation module should reuse utilities defined in utils.py (for example, the learning rate scheduler is not directly needed here, but checkpoint averaging utilities are common to both Trainer and Evaluation if predictions from multiple checkpoints are to be averaged).
• Vocab/tokenizer utilities (to translate token IDs into strings) must be consistent with those in dataset_loader.py.

─────────────────────────────  
6. Reproducibility and Configuration References

• All hyperparameters (beam_size, length_penalty, and the constants for maximum output length) must be read from the config.yaml. No hard-coded values should be used aside from what’s defined in config.
• Ensure that the inference procedure (including early stopping on EOS) strictly follows the experimental design previously described.

Summary

The evaluation.py module will:  
1. Initialize using the provided model, evaluation dataset, and configuration (ensuring model.eval() is set).  
2. For each test example, use an internal beam search (_beam_search) that:
  – Applies the Transformer’s forward function iteratively with proper source and target masking.
  – Uses the beam_search parameters from config (different for translation and parsing).
  – Stops generation early when EOS is reached or max_output_length is met.
3. Decode predicted token sequences to text,
4. Use sacreBLEU (for translation) or a dedicated F1 evaluation function (for parsing) to compute the final metric,
5. Return (and optionally log) a structured dictionary of evaluation metrics.

This analysis lays out all the logical components and flow for implementing evaluation.py in a way that aligns with the paper’s methodologies and our system design.
