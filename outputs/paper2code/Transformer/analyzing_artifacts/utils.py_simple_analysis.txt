Below is a structured logic analysis for utils.py. This file’s purpose is to hold common helper functions that will be shared by Trainer and Evaluation (and possibly other modules) to avoid code duplication. The key components we need to implement are:

1. Configuration Parsing  
 • Function: parse_config(config_path)  
  – Read the YAML configuration file (config.yaml) and convert it into a Python dictionary.  
  – Validate that required sections (training, hyperparameters, dataset, inference) are present.  
  – Handle errors gracefully in case the file is missing or has incorrect formatting.  
  – (If using an external YAML parser like PyYAML, document the dependency or provide appropriate error messages if not found.)

2. Learning Rate Scheduler  
 • Function: get_learning_rate(d_model, step, warmup_steps)  
  – Implements the paper’s formula:  
    lr = d_model^(–0.5) * min(step^(–0.5), step * warmup_steps^(–1.5))  
  – The function accepts the current training step, the model dimension (d_model), and warmup_steps (as provided in the config).  
  – Use math operations (power, multiplication, and minimum) to compute the current learning rate.  
  – Ensure that the case when step == 0 is handled appropriately (or start from step 1) to avoid division by zero.

3. Checkpoint Averaging Utility  
 • Function: average_checkpoints(checkpoint_paths)  
  – Given a list of file paths to saved checkpoints (PyTorch state dicts), load each checkpoint with torch.load().  
  – For every key in the state dictionaries, iterate across all checkpoints and compute an element‐wise average of the tensors.  
  – Return a new state dictionary containing the averaged parameters.  
  – Validate that all checkpoints have the same parameter keys and shape; if not, raise an informative error.  
  – This utility supports the practice described in the paper (averaging the last 5 for base models or 20 for big models).

4. Logging Helpers  
 • Function: setup_logger(log_file=None, level=logging.INFO)  
  – Initialize Python’s logging module to output messages in a consistent format.  
  – If a log_file is provided, configure the logger to write both to the file and the console.  
  – Use standard logging levels (INFO, DEBUG, etc.) and format the messages with timestamps.  
 • Optionally, provide additional helper functions like log_message(message, level) which can wrap logger calls if needed.

5. Additional Utility Functions (if necessary)  
 • It might be useful to include miscellaneous functions such as:  
  – A helper to convert configuration paths or check file existence.  
  – A function to print or log dictionary contents in a structured form for debugging purposes.

Implementation Details and Considerations:  
 – The learning rate function will be called on every training step, so it must be efficient and rely on basic arithmetic operations.  
 – When averaging checkpoints, assure tensor types are consistent. This function must use torch.no_grad() context (or similar practices) to avoid unnecessary gradient tracking.  
 – The config parser must be robust to changes in file layout; using nested dictionaries so that Trainer and Evaluation can easily retrieve settings using keys like config['training']['optimizer'] or config['hyperparameters']['base_model']['d_model'].
 – All utility functions must work with the design’s shared knowledge—ensuring consistency across training and evaluation modules.
 – Maintain clarity and modularity: each helper should do one job well (i.e., single-responsibility principle).  
 – Error messages and logging should be clear to facilitate troubleshooting during experiments, especially when replicating the rigorous experimental setup described in the paper.

By organizing these functions in utils.py, the Trainer (and other modules) can reuse configuration, compute dynamic learning rates per step, average checkpoints after training, and log events effectively. This approach not only aligns with the experimental methodology from the paper but also ensures that all modules are consistent when they operate off the same configuration values from config.yaml.

This logic analysis provides a clear roadmap for writing the code in utils.py without deviating from the overall design and methodology specified earlier.
