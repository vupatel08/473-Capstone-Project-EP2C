Below is a detailed logic analysis for model.py. This analysis outlines how to structure the TransformerModel class (and its required submodules) to match the “Attention Is All You Need” paper, while strictly following the design and configuration provided.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Overall Structure

• The TransformerModel class will be a PyTorch nn.Module. It encapsulates both the encoder and decoder stacks. It also builds the source/target embeddings (which share a weight matrix with the final projection), constructs positional encodings (using the sine–cosine formula), and sets up a final linear projection layer to produce vocabulary logits.

• The forward() function will take:
  – src: tensor for source tokens,
  – tgt: tensor for target tokens,
  – src_mask and tgt_mask: masks to control attention (for padding in the source and for causal masking in the target).

• The model must support different configurations (base vs. big, or even a 4‐layer variant for parsing) by reading parameters such as num_layers, d_model, d_ff, num_heads, dropout, etc., directly from the provided configuration (config.yaml). No additional member functions beyond __init__ and forward should be publicly exposed.

2. Key Submodules and Their Roles

A. Positional Encoding  
  – Create a separate nn.Module (or an internal function within model.py) to compute the sinusoidal positional encodings.
  – Precompute a “lookup” table up to a maximum sequence length. For each position pos and each dimension index i, use:
   • PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/(10000^(2i/d_model)))
   • PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/(10000^(2i/d_model)))
  – In the forward pass, simply add these precomputed encodings to the input embeddings.

B. Multi-Head Attention Module  
  – Implement as its own nn.Module.
  – In __init__, define three linear layers to project the inputs into query (Q), key (K), and value (V) spaces. The output size of each projection should be (num_heads * d_k) where d_k = d_model / num_heads.
  – Also create one final linear layer to combine the concatenated outputs from all heads back to a dimension of d_model.
  – In forward:
   • Project the input(s) using the three linear layers.
   • Reshape the projections to shape (batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, d_k) for Q, K, and V.
   • Compute the dot-product attention scores, scaling by √(d_k). Apply softmax and (optionally) dropout.
   • Multiply the attention probabilities by V for each head.
   • Concatenate the results from all heads and pass them through the final linear projection.

C. Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network  
  – Create an nn.Module that applies two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
  – The first linear layer maps from d_model to d_ff (e.g., 512→2048 for the base model), and the second projects back to d_model.
  – Apply dropout after the activation as needed.

D. Encoder Layer  
  – Each encoder layer has two sub-layers:
   1. A multi-head self-attention block (using the module from B).
   2. A position-wise feed-forward network (from C).
  – Each sub-layer is wrapped with:
   • A residual (skip) connection (i.e., add the original input to the output of the sublayer).
   • Layer normalization applied after the addition.
  – Ensure dropout is applied to the output of each sub-layer _before_ adding it back to the original input.
  – Stack a number of these layers (typically 6 for translation, configurable for parsing) in an nn.ModuleList.

E. Decoder Layer  
  – Each decoder layer consists of three sub-layers:
   1. A self-attention layer over the target sequence (with causal masking to prevent future token access).
   2. An encoder-decoder attention layer where queries come from the target and keys/values come from the encoder output.
   3. A position-wise feed-forward network.
  – Like the encoder, each sub-layer uses residual connections and layer normalization.
  – Stack the decoder layers using an nn.ModuleList.

3. TransformerModel __init__ Construction

• Embeddings:  
  – Create two embedding layers for the source and target vocabularies. According to the design, these embeddings should be tied to the final projection layer (using shared weights).  
  – After looking up the embeddings, multiply them by √(d_model) to scale as recommended in the paper.

• Positional Encoding:  
  – Instantiate the positional encoding module.
  – Add the computed positional encodings to both the source and target embeddings.

• Encoder and Decoder:  
  – The encoder is constructed by stacking the specified encoder layers (e.g., 6 layers for translation, as provided by the configuration).
  – The decoder is similarly built according to its defined number of layers.

• Final Linear Projection:  
  – Build a final linear layer that converts the output of the decoder (of shape [batch, tgt_seq_length, d_model]) to logits over the vocabulary.
  – Ensure that the weight matrix of this output layer is shared with the embedding layers (as per common practice and mentioned in the paper).

• Parameter settings (d_model, d_ff, num_heads, dropout, etc.) are drawn directly from the configuration (e.g., hyperparameters.base_model for the base configuration). Do not hard-code any values.

4. The Forward Pass

A. Source (Encoder Input)  
  1. Pass src tokens through the source embedding layer.
  2. Multiply the embeddings by √(d_model) and add the corresponding positional encodings.
  3. Feed the result through the stack of encoder layers.  
  – The encoder processes the entire source sequence, taking into account the source mask (to ignore padding tokens).

B. Target (Decoder Input)  
  1. Similarly, convert tgt tokens into embeddings; scale by √(d_model) and add positional encodings.
  2. Feed these embeddings through the decoder layers:
   • The first sub-layer performs self-attention with an appropriate mask to prevent “peeking” at future tokens.
   • The second sub-layer performs encoder-decoder attention using the encoder output.
   • The final sub-layer is the feed-forward network.
  3. As in the encoder, each sub-layer applies dropout, residual connections, and layer normalization.

C. Output Generation  
  – The output from the final decoder layer is passed through the final linear layer to convert the hidden states into logits over the vocabulary.
  – Return these logits as the model output.

5. Integration with the Configuration

• The TransformerModel’s __init__ should take a parameter dictionary (or similar configuration object) so that it can select between the base model (d_model=512, d_ff=2048, num_heads=8, etc.) versus the big model (and any variant for parsing).

• All dropout rates, hyperparameters, and the number of layers come directly from the configuration file (config.yaml). For example, for translation experiments, use:
  – hyperparameters.base_model.num_layers (6),
  – hyperparameters.base_model.d_model (512),
  – hyperparameters.base_model.num_heads (8), etc.

• No assumptions or hard-coded values should be introduced beyond what is specified in the configuration.

6. Summary of the Module Hierarchy in model.py

• PositionalEncoding (nn.Module):  
  – Precomputes sinusoidal encodings and adds them to embeddings.

• MultiHeadAttention (nn.Module):  
  – Performs all the operations for scaled dot-product attention across multiple heads.

• PositionWiseFeedForward (nn.Module):  
  – Two-layer feed-forward network with ReLU, mapping d_model → d_ff → d_model.

• EncoderLayer (nn.Module):  
  – Combines a self-attention sublayer and a feed-forward sublayer (each with residual and layer norm).

• Encoder (nn.Module):  
  – Stacks multiple EncoderLayer modules.

• DecoderLayer (nn.Module):  
  – Contains:
   1. Target self-attention (with masking),
   2. Encoder-decoder attention,
   3. Feed-forward network (all with residual connections and layer norm).

• Decoder (nn.Module):  
  – Stacks multiple DecoderLayer modules.

• TransformerModel (nn.Module):  
  – Sets up source and target embeddings (with shared weights), positional encoding, encoder, decoder, and final vocabulary projection.
  – Defines forward(src, tgt, src_mask, tgt_mask) that:
   • Embeds and adds positional encodings to src and tgt.
   • Processes src through the encoder to get the memory.
   • Processes tgt (with masks) through the decoder along with the encoder’s memory.
   • Passes the decoder output through the final linear projection.
   • Returns the resulting logits.

7. Final Considerations

• Ensure that all tensor reshaping, masking, and residual operations follow PyTorch’s best practices.
• Use torch.nn.functional for activations (ReLU and softmax) and torch.sqrt for scaling.
• Adhere strictly to the public interface: only __init__ and forward should be externally visible as per the design.
• The detailed dropout application, layer normalization, and weight sharing are crucial to match the Transformer architecture described in the paper.
• This logic also needs to align with the data processing in dataset_loader.py and the training loop in trainer.py so that tensor shapes and batching conform to expected dimensions.

This logic analysis sets you up to translate the outlined design into code in model.py with full fidelity to the original paper’s methodology and the provided configuration.
