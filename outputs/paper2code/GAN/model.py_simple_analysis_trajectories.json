This plan is designed to capture all key details\u2014from the underlying adversarial framework and network architectures to data handling, training procedures, and evaluation metrics\u2014so that you can later translate it into Python code.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY\n\n\u2022 Adversarial Framework:  \n\u2003 \u2013 Two networks are trained simultaneously:  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 The Generator (G) learns a mapping from a noise prior p\u208dz\u208e(z) to the data space (MNIST images).  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 The Discriminator (D) outputs the probability that an input sample is real (from MNIST) versus generated by G.  \n\u2003 \u2013 The goal is to solve the minimax game:  \n\u2003\u2003 V(G, D) = E\u208dx\u223cpdata\u208e[log(D(x))] + E\u208dz\u223cpz\u208e[log(1 \u2013 D(G(z)))]  \n\u2003 \u2013 G aims to \u201cfool\u201d D (minimizing log(1 \u2013 D(G(z)))), while D aims to correctly classify real and fake data.\n\n\u2022 Training Dynamics:  \n\u2003 \u2013 Alternating updates are used. In each iteration, D is optimized (for k steps\u2014assume k = 1 unless experimenting further) and then G is optimized.  \n\u2003 \u2013 No complex Markov chains or unrolled inference networks are needed\u2014training is done entirely using backpropagation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. DATA PREPARATION (EXPERIMENTAL SETUP)\n\n\u2022 Dataset:  \n\u2003 \u2013 Use the MNIST dataset which consists of 28\u00d728 grayscale images.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Download and split the dataset (commonly 60K training images and 10K testing images).  \n\u2003 \u2013 Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values to the [0, 1] range since the generator\u2019s output activation is sigmoid.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Data Format: For a fully connected network implementation, flatten each image to a 784-dimensional vector.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Create data loaders/batches with a batch size of 128.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. MODEL ARCHITECTURES\n\nNote: The paper mentions two descriptions. One version details a multilayer perceptron with four fully connected layers for both G and D, while another section (Results) mentions using a one-hidden-layer network. To stay in line with the \u201cExperiments\u201d section, the plan below reproduces the four-layer architecture. (If desired, you can later experiment with the simpler architecture mentioned in the Results section.)\n\nA. Generator (G):\n\u2003 \u2013 Input: Noise vector z sampled from a predefined prior p\u208dz\u208e(z).  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Choice of p\u208dz\u208e: Typically use a 100-dimensional vector drawn from either a Normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) or uniform distribution.

Training Loop Outline:\n\u2003 1. Initialize both network parameters (ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds).\n\u2003 2. For each epoch (out of 100):  \n\u2003\u2003 a. For each mini-batch in the dataset:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003 i. Sample a mini-batch of real images from MNIST.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003 ii. Sample a mini-batch of noise vectors (from p\u208dz\u208e, e.g., 100-dimensional vector).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003 iii. Forward pass:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Compute D(x) for the real batch.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Generate fake images: G(z) and compute D(G(z)).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003 iv.

Quantitative Evaluation:\n\u2003 \u2013 Inception Score:  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 The paper mentions using the Inception Score for quantitative evaluation.  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Note: The traditional Inception Score is computed using a network pretrained on ImageNet. For MNIST, you might need to adapt the evaluation by either training a simple classifier on MNIST or using an existing one to compute the score.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Document and compare the quantitative measures to those reported in the paper.\n\nC.

CLARIFICATIONS & POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES\n\n\u2022 Architectural Inconsistency:  \n\u2003 \u2013 The \u201cExperiments\u201d section outlines a multilayer perceptron with four fully connected layers for both G and D. However, later in the \u201cResults\u201d section, a simpler one-hidden-layer version is mentioned.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Strategy: Begin with the detailed four-layer architecture as this is more explicit, and if needed, experiment with the one-hidden-layer design as a variant. Document whichever choice is implemented.\n\n\u2022 Number of Updates for D (parameter k):  \n\u2003 \u2013 The paper states \u201calternate between k steps of optimizing D and one step of optimizing G\u201d without specifying k.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Strategy: Start with k = 1 (which is common in many GAN implementations) and consider experimenting with different values if training stability issues arise.\n\n\u2022 Noise Prior p\u208dz\u208e(z):  \n\u2003 \u2013 The paper specifies the existence of a noise prior but does not detail its distribution or dimensionality.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Strategy: Choose a dimension (commonly 100) and a standard distribution (e.g., Normal(0,1) or Uniform) for z, and document your selection.\n\n\u2022 Generator Loss Function Choice:  \n\u2003 \u2013 While the paper uses the loss log(1 \u2013 D(G(z))) for G, it is known that this formulation can saturate early in training.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Keep in mind that if practical training issues occur, you might consider the alternative, but for strict reproducibility, start with the original formulation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n7. ENVIRONMENT AND REPRODUCIBILITY\n\n\u2022 Set Up the Development Environment:  \n\u2003 \u2013 Choose a deep-learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).  \n\u2003 \u2013 Ensure that all dependencies (NumPy, data-loading libraries, etc.) are installed.\n\u2003 \u2013 Set random seeds to ensure reproducibility.\n\u2003 \u2013 Document system environment details (version numbers, hardware accelerators like GPUs, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Logging & Checkpointing:  \n\u2003 \u2013 Save model checkpoints at regular intervals.\n\u2003 \u2013 Log training metrics (loss curves for both G and D) and generated sample snapshots for later analysis.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n8.
