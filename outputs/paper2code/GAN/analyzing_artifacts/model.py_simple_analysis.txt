Below is the detailed logic analysis for model.py. This module is responsible for defining the GAN’s architectures according to the experimental design and configuration settings, ensuring that the Generator and Discriminator strictly adhere to the specifications from both the paper and config.yaml.

──────────────────────────────
1. OVERALL STRUCTURE

• The module will import PyTorch (torch and torch.nn) and use it for building neural network modules.
• It will define three classes:
  – Generator (a subclass of nn.Module)
  – Discriminator (a subclass of nn.Module)
  – GANModel (a container class that holds both Generator and Discriminator and offers build_generator() and build_discriminator() methods)
• The classes will follow the interfaces defined in the design:
  – The Generator and Discriminator classes must implement a forward(x: Tensor) method.
  – GANModel.__init__(params: dict) will accept configuration parameters and store them for building the networks.

──────────────────────────────
2. GENERATOR CLASS (nn.Module Subclass)

• Purpose:
  – To implement a four-layer fully connected network that maps a noise vector z (sampled from a prior p₍z₎, assumed to be 100 dimensions by default) to an output matching the MNIST image dimensionality (28×28 = 784, flattened).
  – Each hidden layer uses a linear transformation, then applies Batch Normalization (since config “batch_normalization” is true) and ReLU activation.
  – The output layer maps from the last hidden unit (100, as specified in the config’s list [1000, 500, 250, 100]) to 784, followed by a sigmoid activation (as per config’s “output_activation”).

• Steps:
  1. Define an input dimension for the noise vector (assume 100 as a default value, as the noise dimensionality is not explicitly provided).
  2. Retrieve the hidden layer sizes from the configuration (i.e., [1000, 500, 250, 100]).
  3. Build the network by:
   a. Creating the first linear layer that maps from the noise vector (100) to 1000 units.
   b. For each hidden layer, add:
    – A linear (fully connected) layer.
    – (Immediately after the linear layer) a BatchNorm1d layer (if enabled in the config).
    – A ReLU activation.
  4. After processing all hidden layers, add a final linear layer that maps from the last hidden unit (100) to 784.
  5. Apply a final Sigmoid activation (to squash outputs to the [0, 1] range, matching the normalized pixel values).

• Implementation Note:
  – Layers can be assembled using an nn.Sequential container or by manually constructing each layer.
  – Convert the string “ReLU” and “sigmoid” from the config into their corresponding PyTorch classes (nn.ReLU and nn.Sigmoid).

• Forward Method:
  – The forward(z: Tensor) will pass the input noise vector through the entire sequential network and return the generated 784-dimensional output.

3. DISCRIMINATOR CLASS (nn.Module Subclass)

• Purpose:
  – To implement a four-layer fully connected network that takes in a flattened MNIST image (784 dimensions) and outputs the probability (using a sigmoid) that the image is real.
  – Each hidden layer, except for the final one, applies a linear transformation, optionally followed by Batch Normalization and a ReLU activation (as specified in the config).

• Steps:
  1. Define the input dimension as 784 (flattened MNIST image).
  2. Retrieve the hidden layer sizes from the configuration for the Discriminator (i.e., [1000, 500, 250, 1]).
  3. Build the network by:
   a. Creating the first linear layer from 784 to 1000.
   b. For the hidden layers:
    – Add a linear layer.
    – If batch normalization is enabled in the config, add a BatchNorm1d layer.
    – Follow with a ReLU activation.
   c. When creating the final layer:
    – Map from the last hidden units to a single output.
    – Apply a Sigmoid activation function to produce a probability.

• Implementation Note:
  – The network’s layers are created in a sequential manner ensuring that the dimensions match.
  – Use the configuration’s “activation” string to select ReLU and “output_activation” for the final sigmoid activation.

• Forward Method:
  – The forward(x: Tensor) will pass the flattened image through the sequential layers and return the discriminator’s probability.

4. GANMODEL CLASS

• Purpose:
  – To serve as an encapsulated container for both the Generator and the Discriminator.
  – Provide two methods:
   – build_generator() : Instantiates and returns a Generator with the proper configuration.
   – build_discriminator() : Instantiates and returns a Discriminator with the proper configuration.
  – This design keeps the model creation modular and allows other parts of the program (e.g., trainer.py) to simply call these methods.

• Steps:
  1. In the __init__(params: dict) method, store the configuration parameters (which include sections for model.generator and model.discriminator).
  2. Implement build_generator() to:
   – Pass the necessary parameters from the configuration to the Generator constructor.
   – Return the instantiated Generator object.
  3. Implement build_discriminator() similarly:
   – Pass the Discriminator parameters from the configuration.
   – Return the instantiated Discriminator object.

5. EDGE CASES & ASSUMPTIONS

• Noise Vector Dimensionality:
  – Although not explicitly specified in the config, it is standard to assume a 100-dimensional noise vector for GANs.
  – This value should be hardcoded (or documented as a default) in the Generator’s constructor.

• Order of Operations within Each Layer:
  – The typical approach is to use a linear transformation followed by Batch Normalization and then a ReLU activation,
   which will be followed by the next linear layer. The final output layer uses a sigmoid activation.
  – Do not add any extra layers or public member functions that are not in the design.

• Strict Adherence:
  – Ensure that the architecture strictly follows the provided configuration (layer sizes, activation functions, and use of batch normalization).
  – Do not deviate from the design since trainer.py and other modules expect these interfaces exactly.

6. SUMMARY

• Generator:
  – Input: 100-dimensional noise vector.
  – Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with output sizes of 1000, 500, 250, 100 (each followed by BatchNorm and ReLU).
  – Output: A linear mapping from the final hidden layer (100) to 784 units, with a Sigmoid activation.

• Discriminator:
  – Input: 784-dimensional flattened MNIST image.
  – Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with sizes 1000, 500, 250 (each followed by BatchNorm and ReLU).
  – Output: A final fully connected layer mapping to 1 unit with a Sigmoid activation (to produce a probability).

• GANModel:
  – Acts as a container that holds both network definitions.
  – Provides build_generator() and build_discriminator() methods to instantiate the networks using configuration values.

This logic analysis ensures that when you write the code for model.py, the implementation will respect the experimental design, follow the specified config.yaml parameters exactly, and maintain modularity as expected by the overall project structure.
