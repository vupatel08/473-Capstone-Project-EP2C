[Logic Analysis]
- ['dataset_loader.py', 'DatasetLoader class: Responsible for downloading the MNIST dataset using torchvision, applying necessary transformations (normalization to [0,1] and flattening to 784-dim vectors), and creating training and test dataloaders. It will utilize torch.utils.data.DataLoader to generate mini-batches with batch_size=128.']
- ['model.py', 'GANModel module: Contains definitions for the Generator and Discriminator classes. Both are implemented as torch.nn.Module subclasses. The Generator utilizes a 4-layer fully connected network with 1000, 500, 250, 100 hidden units respectively, ReLU activations, batch normalization, and a final sigmoid layer to output a 784-dimensional vector. The Discriminator is similarly structured with four layers (1000, 500, 250, 1 hidden units) using ReLU, batch normalization, and a sigmoid output for the real/fake probability. This file ensures architectural consistency and modularity.']
- ['trainer.py', 'Trainer class: Implements the training loop for the GAN. It takes the model (both Generator and Discriminator), dataloaders from the DatasetLoader, and configuration parameters. It sets up Adam optimizers (lr=0.0002 and beta1=0.5). The training loop alternates updates between the Discriminator and the Generator (assuming k=1 discriminator update per generator update), computes the binary cross-entropy losses for real and fake samples, logs the losses, uses tqdm for progress monitoring, and saves checkpoints periodically.']
- ['evaluation.py', 'Evaluation class: Handles post-training evaluation. Responsible for qualitative visualization (generating images using a fixed noise vector and saving/displaying the images with matplotlib) and quantitative evaluation (computing metrics such as Inception Score, which may require a pretrained classifier on MNIST or a custom metric implementation).']
- ['main.py', 'Main script: Serves as the entry point for the software. It loads configuration parameters, instantiates the DatasetLoader to fetch the data, builds the GANModel (which includes Generator and Discriminator), passes all components to the Trainer, triggers the training process, and finally calls the Evaluation module to assess model performance.']

[Shared Knowledge]
Shared configuration variables (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs, noise vector dimension, random seed) will be used across all modules. Utility functions for logging, checkpointing, and setting random seeds are common and may either be implemented as a separate utilities module or embedded within the main modules, ensuring consistency in experiment reproducibility.

----------------------------------------
[Anything UNCLEAR]
Clarification is needed on the exact noise vector dimensionality and distribution (although 100-dim Normal is a common choice) and the exact method for computing the quantitative evaluation metric (Inception Score) on MNIST data. Additionally, confirmation is required on whether to implement the detailed 4-layer architecture or the simplified one-hidden-layer variant mentioned in the paper's Results section.
