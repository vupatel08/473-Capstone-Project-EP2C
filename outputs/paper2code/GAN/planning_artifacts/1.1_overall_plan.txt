Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step roadmap for reproducing the experiments and methodology described in the paper. This plan is designed to capture all key details—from the underlying adversarial framework and network architectures to data handling, training procedures, and evaluation metrics—so that you can later translate it into Python code.

──────────────────────────────
1. OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY

• Adversarial Framework:  
  – Two networks are trained simultaneously:  
   • The Generator (G) learns a mapping from a noise prior p₍z₎(z) to the data space (MNIST images).  
   • The Discriminator (D) outputs the probability that an input sample is real (from MNIST) versus generated by G.  
  – The goal is to solve the minimax game:  
   V(G, D) = E₍x∼pdata₎[log(D(x))] + E₍z∼pz₎[log(1 – D(G(z)))]  
  – G aims to “fool” D (minimizing log(1 – D(G(z)))), while D aims to correctly classify real and fake data.

• Training Dynamics:  
  – Alternating updates are used. In each iteration, D is optimized (for k steps—assume k = 1 unless experimenting further) and then G is optimized.  
  – No complex Markov chains or unrolled inference networks are needed—training is done entirely using backpropagation.

2. DATA PREPARATION (EXPERIMENTAL SETUP)

• Dataset:  
  – Use the MNIST dataset which consists of 28×28 grayscale images.  
  – Download and split the dataset (commonly 60K training images and 10K testing images).  
  – Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values to the [0, 1] range since the generator’s output activation is sigmoid.  
  – Data Format: For a fully connected network implementation, flatten each image to a 784-dimensional vector.  
  – Create data loaders/batches with a batch size of 128.

3. MODEL ARCHITECTURES

Note: The paper mentions two descriptions. One version details a multilayer perceptron with four fully connected layers for both G and D, while another section (Results) mentions using a one-hidden-layer network. To stay in line with the “Experiments” section, the plan below reproduces the four-layer architecture. (If desired, you can later experiment with the simpler architecture mentioned in the Results section.)

A. Generator (G):
  – Input: Noise vector z sampled from a predefined prior p₍z₎(z).  
   • Choice of p₍z₎: Typically use a 100-dimensional vector drawn from either a Normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) or uniform distribution. (The paper does not specify, so choose one and document your choice.)
  – Architecture:  
   1. Fully Connected Layer: 1000 hidden units  
    - Activation: ReLU  
    - Apply Batch Normalization (after the activation or before the subsequent layer as per preferred implementation)
   2. Fully Connected Layer: 500 hidden units  
    - Activation: ReLU  
    - Batch Normalization  
   3. Fully Connected Layer: 250 hidden units  
    - Activation: ReLU  
    - Batch Normalization  
   4. Fully Connected Layer: 100 hidden units  
    - Activation: ReLU and/or Batch Normalization if needed (consistent with earlier layers)  
   5. Output Layer: Fully Connected layer to match the image dimensions (e.g., 784 for MNIST).  
    - Activation: Sigmoid (to match the [0, 1] pixel value range)

B. Discriminator (D):
  – Input: Real (flattened) MNIST image or generated sample from G  
  – Architecture:  
   1. Fully Connected Layer: 1000 neurons  
    - Activation: ReLU  
    - Batch Normalization  
   2. Fully Connected Layer: 500 neurons  
    - Activation: ReLU  
    - Batch Normalization  
   3. Fully Connected Layer: 250 neurons  
    - Activation: ReLU  
    - Batch Normalization  
   4. Output Layer: Fully Connected layer with 1 neuron  
    - Activation: Sigmoid (to obtain a probability score)

4. TRAINING PROCEDURE

A. Hyperparameters:
  – Optimizer: Adam for both networks  
   • Learning Rate: 0.0002  
   • β₁ (beta1): 0.5  
  – Batch Size: 128  
  – Epochs: Train for 100 epochs  
  – Update Strategy: Alternate between training D (for k steps – assume k=1 initially) and one step for G in each iteration.

B. Loss Functions:
  – Discriminator Loss:  
   • For real samples: Use binary cross-entropy loss with target label 1.  
   • For fake samples: Use binary cross-entropy loss with target label 0.  
   • Total D loss is the sum (or average) of the losses for real and fake inputs.
  – Generator Loss:  
   • Compute loss as the binary cross-entropy for D(G(z)) against the target label of 0 (i.e., minimizing log(1 – D(G(z)))).  
   • Note: Although many implementations later use an alternative “non-saturating” loss (maximizing log(D(G(z)))), the paper specifies minimizing log(1-D(G(z))).

C. Training Loop Outline:
  1. Initialize both network parameters (ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds).
  2. For each epoch (out of 100):  
   a. For each mini-batch in the dataset:  
    i. Sample a mini-batch of real images from MNIST.  
    ii. Sample a mini-batch of noise vectors (from p₍z₎, e.g., 100-dimensional vector).  
    iii. Forward pass:  
    – Compute D(x) for the real batch.  
    – Generate fake images: G(z) and compute D(G(z)).  
    iv. Compute Discriminator loss: Combine losses for real and generated data.  
    v. Update D’s parameters using backpropagation (optimize for k steps, typically k = 1).  
    vi. Compute Generator loss: Evaluate loss from D’s response to G(z).  
    vii. Update G’s parameters and backpropagate gradients.  
   b. Log metrics: Keep track of loss values, and periodically (e.g., every N iterations or epochs) generate a fixed set of samples from a constant noise input for visual evaluation.
  3. Save model checkpoints and training logs for further analysis.

5. EVALUATION

A. Qualitative Evaluation:
  – Visual Inspection: Periodically generate a set of fake MNIST digits from the generator and visually compare them to real digits.
  – Save generated samples as images to monitor qualitative progress over epochs.

B. Quantitative Evaluation:
  – Inception Score:  
   • The paper mentions using the Inception Score for quantitative evaluation.  
   • Note: The traditional Inception Score is computed using a network pretrained on ImageNet. For MNIST, you might need to adapt the evaluation by either training a simple classifier on MNIST or using an existing one to compute the score.  
  – Document and compare the quantitative measures to those reported in the paper.

C. Reporting:
  – Plot losses for both G and D versus iterations/epochs.  
  – Plot the progression of generated samples through the course of training.  
  – If computed, compare your Inception Score or any other selected metric with benchmark values.

6. CLARIFICATIONS & POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES

• Architectural Inconsistency:  
  – The “Experiments” section outlines a multilayer perceptron with four fully connected layers for both G and D. However, later in the “Results” section, a simpler one-hidden-layer version is mentioned.  
  – Strategy: Begin with the detailed four-layer architecture as this is more explicit, and if needed, experiment with the one-hidden-layer design as a variant. Document whichever choice is implemented.

• Number of Updates for D (parameter k):  
  – The paper states “alternate between k steps of optimizing D and one step of optimizing G” without specifying k.  
  – Strategy: Start with k = 1 (which is common in many GAN implementations) and consider experimenting with different values if training stability issues arise.

• Noise Prior p₍z₎(z):  
  – The paper specifies the existence of a noise prior but does not detail its distribution or dimensionality.  
  – Strategy: Choose a dimension (commonly 100) and a standard distribution (e.g., Normal(0,1) or Uniform) for z, and document your selection.

• Generator Loss Function Choice:  
  – While the paper uses the loss log(1 – D(G(z))) for G, it is known that this formulation can saturate early in training.  
  – Keep in mind that if practical training issues occur, you might consider the alternative, but for strict reproducibility, start with the original formulation.

7. ENVIRONMENT AND REPRODUCIBILITY

• Set Up the Development Environment:  
  – Choose a deep-learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).  
  – Ensure that all dependencies (NumPy, data-loading libraries, etc.) are installed.
  – Set random seeds to ensure reproducibility.
  – Document system environment details (version numbers, hardware accelerators like GPUs, etc.).

• Logging & Checkpointing:  
  – Save model checkpoints at regular intervals.
  – Log training metrics (loss curves for both G and D) and generated sample snapshots for later analysis.

8. SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

• Step 1: Prepare the MNIST dataset by normalization and flattening.  
• Step 2: Build the Generator and Discriminator networks with the specified architectures, using ReLU activations, batch normalization, and sigmoid outputs where needed.  
• Step 3: Define the loss functions and optimizers (Adam with lr = 0.0002 and β₁ = 0.5).  
• Step 4: Implement the training loop with alternating updates (D updates then G update) over 100 epochs using batch size 128.  
• Step 5: Set up logging, checkpoints, and both qualitative (sample visualization) and quantitative (Inception Score) evaluation metrics.  
• Step 6: Address noted ambiguities (e.g., architecture depth, number of discriminator steps, noise prior choice) by documenting your implementation choices and, if desired, experimenting with alternatives.

Following this detailed roadmap will enable you to write code that faithfully reproduces the experiments described in the paper while also providing ample opportunity to document and validate the reproducibility of the results.
