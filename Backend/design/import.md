### Task Instructions

You are a **Python class and function designer**. Your task is to **determine and specify the import relationships between all files described in `code_structure`**, and then **merge these dependencies into the `code_structure` content itself**.

1. **Add a `Dependencies` Section**:  
   - For every file, create a section titled **"Dependencies"**.  
   - List the classes or functions it imports from other files, including their originating file names.  
   - If you discover any mismatched parameter names or quantities when importing functionalities, **modify this file’s class/function design** to ensure consistent usage.  
   - Other than these necessary modifications, keep the rest of the file’s details unchanged.

2. **Adjust Classes and Functions as Needed**:  
   - If a file needs to import functionalities that take different parameters than originally specified, update the method or function definition to match.  
   - Explicitly reflect how imported functions or classes are utilized in the method/function descriptions.

3. **Special Handling for `config.json`**:  
   - Since `config.json` does not contain classes or functions, it should still be represented in the final `code_structure`.  
   - For `config.json`, simply include a **"##content##"** or similar heading within its file entry to indicate that it holds configuration data but has no method or class design.

4. **Final Output**:  
   - Your final output should be an updated version of the provided `code_structure` in which **each file** now has:
     1. **File Name**  
     2. **Implementation** (as already described in `code_structure`)  
     3. **Dependencies**  
        - Indicate which classes/functions are imported from which files.  
     4. **Classes and Functions**  
        - Maintain the original content but revise as needed to fix any discrepancies and clearly show how the imported functionalities are used.  
   - For `config.json`, you only need to add a dedicated section (e.g., `"##content##"`) rather than detailing classes or functions.

### Expected Output Format

For each file in `code_structure`, provide the following structure:

1. **File Name**

2. **Implementation**  
   - Carry over the original description of the file’s purpose and content from `code_structure`.

3. **Dependencies**  
   - **Imports**: List any classes or functions imported from other files, specifying the source file (e.g., `"from data.loader import DataLoader"`).  
   - If any parameter mismatches or usage discrepancies exist, mention how you adjusted this file’s design to ensure consistency.

4. **Classes and Functions** (when applicable)  
   - **Primary Class** or **Function Name**:  
     - **Purpose**: Summarize what this class/function does, consistent with the original content from `code_structure`.  
     - **Attributes / Parameters**: List them, ensuring they match references in imported functionality.  
     - **Methods**: For each method, describe its function, referencing any imported classes or functions it calls.  
   - **Supporting Classes/Functions** (if any).

For **`config.json`**:  
- Since there are no classes or functions, simply provide the file’s name and a **"##content##"** heading or short note indicating it contains configuration settings without methods.
