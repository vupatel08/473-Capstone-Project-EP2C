## 🔗 Code-to-Paper Traceability

This section shows which parts of the paper each code component implements.

| Code Component | Paper Reference | Description |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `which` | The information provided is insufficient to determine the most relevant paper sections for the code component. Please provide more details about the code component and the paper sections. | Implements specification from paper |
| `Evaluation` | Without specific section names, it's hard to provide an accurate answer. However, based on the code component description, the most relevant sections could be "Methodology", "Model Evaluation", "Results and Discussion". | Implements specification from paper |
| `for` | The provided information is insufficient to determine the most relevant paper sections for the code component. Please provide more details about the code component and the paper sections. | Implements specification from paper |
| `TruthXModel` | Methodology, Results, Discussion | Implements specification from paper |
| `TruthfulQADataset` | Dataset Description, Methodology, Experiment Setup | Implements specification from paper |
| `DatasetLoader` | Dataset Preparation, Methodology, Experiment Setup | Implements specification from paper |
| `which` | The provided information is insufficient to determine the most relevant paper sections for the code component. Please provide more details about the code component and the paper sections. | Implements specification from paper |
| `Trainer` | Methodology, Experiment Setup, Model Implementation | Implements specification from paper |
| `with` | The provided information is insufficient to determine the most relevant paper sections for the code component. Please provide more details about the code component and the paper sections. | Implements specification from paper |

## ⚠️ Missing Information & Manual Configuration Required

The following information was **not specified in the paper** and requires manual attention:

🟢 **hardware**: GPU/CUDA code found but hardware requirements not specified in paper
   - Suggestion: Verify GPU requirements match paper's experimental setup


---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Review configuration
cat config.yaml

# 3. Run the implementation
python main.py
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Ensure datasets are downloaded (see `dataset_loader.py`)
   - Verify data paths in `config.yaml`

2. **Configuration Review**:
   - Open `config.yaml` and verify all hyperparameters
   - Pay special attention to ⚠️ marked parameters (see Missing Information section)

3. **Training**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   python evaluation.py
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Review Missing Information**: Check the ⚠️ section above
2. **Update Configuration**: Modify `config.yaml` with appropriate values
3. **Verify Dataset**: Ensure your dataset matches the paper specifications

### Recommended Workflow

1. ✅ Review paper-code traceability (see mapping table)
2. ✅ Update missing hyperparameters in `config.yaml`
3. ✅ Download and verify dataset compatibility
4. ✅ Run training with default settings
5. ✅ Compare results with paper benchmarks
6. ✅ Iterate on hyperparameters if needed
