Activating the truthfulness within LLM is the key to fully unlocking LLM\u2019s knowledge potential. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inference-time intervention method to activate the truthfulness of LLM by identifying and editing the features within LLM\u2019s internal representations that govern the truthfulness. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM\u2019s representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM\u2019s internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLM. Experiments show that TruthX improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of $20 \\%$ on TruthfulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that TruthX can control LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses via editing only one vector in LLM\u2019s internal representations1.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a). However, LLMs sometimes generate fluent, instruction-compliant yet untruthful responses, commonly referred to as \u201challucinations\u201d (Ji et al., 2023). This phenomenon significantly undermines the credibility of LLMs in applications. Mitigating hallucinations of LLMs poses a substantial challenge, as hallucinations may stem from various factors, such as blindly following instructions, noisy data, lack of knowledge and the generation process (Zhang et al., 2023c).\n\n![](images/5fa6b8db65c3f8f2b55713c51d960c59625238effad11703d18246d867d867f6.jpg)  \nFigure 1: A case to show that TruthX can control LLM to generate truthful or hallucinatory coherent responses via editing one vector in LLM\u2019s internal representations.\n\nPreceding such factors, a more fundamental issue is: whether LLMs can consistently generate truthful responses, even when they possess the correct knowledge? Recent researches suggest \u201cno\u201d for this question. For instance, Wei et al. (2022) found that LLMs can generate truthful responses in some contexts while producing hallucinations in others. Kadavath et al. (2022) and Dhuliawala et al. (2023) discovered that LLMs can identify the presence of hallucinations generated by themselves through self-validation. Saunders et al. (2022) directly pointed out the existence of the generationdiscrimination gap in LLMs. All these findings indicate that LLMs, even equipped with correct knowledge, are still susceptible to producing hallucinations during the generation process. Further, some works found a correlation between the\n\nLLMs\u2019 internal representations and the truthfulness of outputs (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Zhao et al., 2024), where some erroneous activations of internal representations lead LLMs to generate hallucinations even when they know the correct knowledge (Li et al., 2023b; Zou et al., 2023). Therefore, activating a well-trained LLM to generate truthful responses is the crucial first step in alleviating the hallucination of LLMs.\n\nTo this end, we propose TruthX, a truthfulness enhancement approach by editing LLM\u2019s internal representations in the truthful space. To edit LLM in the truthful space without compromising its generative capabilities, TruthX decouples the LLM\u2019s internal representations into truthful and semantic latent spaces respectively using an autoencoder. Then, TruthX employs contrastive learning to probe representations (Alain and Bengio, 2017; Belinkov, 2022) with similar semantics but opposite truthfulness and those with similar truthfulness but different semantics within these two latent spaces. During inference, TruthX effectively regulates the truthfulness of LLM by editing it in the truthful space, while ensuring that the generation capability remains intact. Figure 1 illustrates an example of TruthX controlling LLM to generate either truthful or hallucinatory coherent responses.\n\nExperimental results show that TruthX enhances the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs, including Llama, Mistral, Baichuan and Chatglm, by an average of $20 \\%$ on TruthfulQA benchmark. Through further analyses, we get the following findings:\n\n\u2022 TruthX exhibits superiority in truthfulness control. Editing LLMs along the truthful direction can enhance the truthfulness of responses, conversely, editing LLMs along the opposite direction yields highly hallucinatory responses.\n\n\u2022 The truthful space extracted from homologous LLMs (i.e., trained sequentially) exhibits a high degree of similarity, so we can directly adopt a well-trained TruthX to different homologous models for truthfulness enhancement.\n\n\u2022 Layer-wise analysis indicates that the representations in middle layers of LLMs exhibit a higher correlation with the truthfulness of responses.\n\n# 2 Related Work\n\nRecent efforts aim to enhance LLM\u2019s truthfulness during inference, falling into contrast decoding and representation editing. Contrast decoding modifies output probabilities based on comparisons between strong/weak models (Li et al., 2023c). By using a weak model with illusions, contrast decoding can improve the truthfulness of LLM (Chuang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Kai et al., 2024).\n\nRepresentation editing has garnered increasing attention due to its controllability and lightweight properties. Early studies have demonstrated that tasks such as style transfer (Subramani et al., 2022; Hernandez et al., 2023) and controllable text generation (Dathathri et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022) can be achieved by editing model representations. Recently, Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023) finds truthful directions using paired internal activations. Inference-time Intervention (ITI) (Li et al., 2023b) probes and adjusts truthfulness within the attention heads of LLM. Expanding on ITI, Truth Forest (TrFr) (Chen et al., 2024) incorporates orthogonal constraints to refine probing capabilities. While ITI and Trfr have shown promising results, only editing attention heads for minimal interference to the generative capabilities (Brown et al., 2023; Hase et al., 2023) limits their enhancement of LLM\u2019s truthfulness (Li et al., 2023b), as FFN module is always considered a knowledge memory (Geva et al., 2021; Hernandez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a). To this end, we propose TruthX, which focuses on all internal representations of LLM rather than solely on attention heads. Furthermore, TruthX probes and edits in the truthful space, thereby demonstrating more effective truthfulness enhancement and greater editing flexibility.\n\n# 3 TruthX\n\nTo activate the truthfulness of a well-trained LLM, we introduce TruthX to edit its internal representations in truthful space. Figure 2 illustrates the diagram of TruthX.\n\n# 3.1 Extracting Internal Representations\n\nMost LLMs typically consist of stacked Transformer blocks, where each block comprises an attention module and a feed-forward neural network (FFN) module interconnected by residual connections (Vaswani et al., 2017). As depicted in Figure 2(a), the generation of the next token in an LLM can be conceptualized as the residual connections serving as the main stream, while the attention and FFN modules extract information from the contexts and parameters and add them to the residual stream (Meng et al., 2022). Naturally, hallucinations should logically originate from the representations generated by these attention (Li et al., 2023b) and FFN modules (Geva et al., 2021, 2022). Therefore, we aim to probe these internal representations.\n\n![](images/a14bfe84b233ed0b90a66fec3edc37993a6417a32c7b1d5cf26fdb7608d18d7a.jpg)  \nFigure 2: The schematic diagram of TruthX, which maps the LLM\u2019s internal representations into truthful and semantic latent spaces, and then probes and edits the LLM in the truthful space, thereby enhancing its truthfulness.\n\nTo this end, we first stimulate LLM with both truthful and untruthful responses and extract its internal representations when generating content with opposite truthfulness. To do so, we construct triplets $\\mathcal { D } = \\{ ( Q , A ^ { p o s } , A ^ { n e g } ) \\}$ , where $Q$ is the question, $A ^ { p o s }$ is a truthful answer, and $A ^ { n e g }$ is an untruthful answer. Given $\\mathcal { D }$ , we stimulate LLM with either $Q + A ^ { p o s }$ or $Q + A ^ { n e g }$ to extract the corresponding internal representations.\n\nTo minimize the interference in probing caused by divergent token semantics, we only extract the internal representations of those tokens that appear simultaneously in both $A ^ { p o s }$ and $A ^ { n e g }$ , thereby ensuring maximal semantic similarity between representations. Formally, we extract the representations of the attention modules and FFN modules\u2019 outputs in each layer when presented with truthful and untruthful stimuli, denoted as $X ^ { p o s } = \\{ x ^ { p o s } \\}$ and $X ^ { n e g } = \\{ x ^ { n e g } \\}$ , where $x ^ { p o s } , x ^ { n e g } \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { m o d e l } }$ are the representations of the same token under truthful/untruthful stimuli, respectively, $d _ { m o d e l }$ is the dimension of the LLM\u2019s hidden states.\n\n# 3.2 Probing with Auto-Encoder\n\nGiven the internal representations of LLM, we map them to the truthful and semantic latent spaces using an auto-encoder. As depicted in Figure 2(b), the auto-encoder consists of a truthful encoder, a semantic encoder and a decoder, all implemented with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).\n\nRepresentation Reconstruction The primary objective of auto-encoder is to map LLM\u2019s internal representation to different latent spaces via encoders, and then reconstruct itself through decoder (Wang et al., 2016). First, truthful encoder TruthEnc(\u00b7) and semantic encoder $\\operatorname { S e m E n c } ( \\cdot )$ map the internal representations $x \\in \\{ X ^ { p o s } , X ^ { n e g } \\}$ to the truthful space and semantic space respectively:\n\n$$\nh _ { t r u t h } \\mathrm { = } \\mathrm { T r u t h E n c } ( x ) , h _ { s e m } \\mathrm { = S e m E n c } ( x ) ,\n$$\n\nwhere $h _ { t r u t h } , h _ { s e m } \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { l a t e n t } }$ are the latent representations in truthful and semantic space respectively, $d _ { l a t e n t }$ is the dimension of latent representations. Then, decoder $\\mathrm { D e c } ( \\cdot )$ reconstructs the LLM\u2019s internal representations from the latent space representations, calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol { x } ^ { ' } = \\operatorname { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } + \\mathrm { A t t n } \\left( h _ { s e m } , h _ { t r u t h } \\right) ) ,\n$$\n\nwhere $x ^ { ' }$ is the reconstructed representations, Attn is an attention operation from semantic latent representations (serving as query) to truthful latent representations (serving as key and value). The auto-encoder is optimized through the reconstruction loss $\\mathcal { L } _ { \\mathit { r e c o n } }$ between $x ^ { ' }$ and $x$ , calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal { L } _ { r e c o n } = \\mathrm { M S E } ( x , x ^ { ' } ) ,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm { M S E ( \\cdot ) }$ is mean square error loss function.\n\nContrastive Learning To encourage the truthful and semantic spaces to capture truthful and semantic features respectively, we employ contrastive learning on the latent representation within these two spaces. Specifically, our purpose is to create a clear demarcation between truthful and untruthful samples within the truthful space, and between samples with different semantics within the semantic space. Contrastive learning is a common technique used to achieve this goal (Sohn, 2016). Here, we first provide the general objective of contrastive learning. For a representation $s$ in the space, we construct a set of samples $S ^ { + }$ with the same class and a set of samples $S ^ { - }$ from different classes. Contrastive learning aligns representations in the space by minimizing the distance between $s$ and $S ^ { + }$ while maximizing the distance between $s$ and $S ^ { - }$ , where the training objective is calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { C T R } ( s , S ^ { + } , S ^ { - } ) = } \\\\ & { - \\log \\frac { \\sum _ { s ^ { \\prime } \\in S ^ { + } } \\exp ( s i m ( s , s ^ { \\prime } / \\tau ) } { \\sum _ { s ^ { \\prime } \\in ( S ^ { + } , S ^ { - } ) } \\exp \\left( s i m \\left( s , s ^ { \\prime } \\right) / \\tau \\right) } . } \\end{array}\n$$\n\n$s i m ( \\cdot , \\cdot )$ refers to cosine similarity between representations, and $\\tau = 0 . 1$ is the temperature.\n\nSince contrastive learning is employed on the entire dataset (Tian et al., 2020), we denote the set composed of latent representations in truthful space of all positive samples $x ^ { p o s } \\in X ^ { p o s }$ a s Hpos and those of negative samples $x ^ { p o s } \\in X ^ { n e g }$ as $H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ . Similarly, the set composed of semantic latent representations of all positive and negative samples are denoted as $H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ and $H _ { s e m } ^ { n e g }$ respectively.\n\nIn the truthful space, the latent representations of truthful and untruthful samples should be differentiated. Therefore, for a given sample $h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ , those samples sharing the same truthfulness Hpostrut form $S ^ { + }$ , while those with opposite truthfulness $H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ form $S ^ { - }$ . The contrastive learning is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathcal { L } _ { t r u t h } = \\mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) } \\\\ { + \\mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) . } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn the semantic space, the latent representations of samples with different token meanings shodifferentiated. Therefore, for a given sample $h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ its corresponding $h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g }$ from the same token but opposite truthfulness form $S ^ { + }$ , while those representations with the same truthfulness but different meaning form $S ^ { - }$ . The contrastive learning is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathcal { L } _ { s e m } = \\mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } , h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } , H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } \\setminus h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } ) } \\\\ { + \\mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } , h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } , H _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } \\setminus h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } ) , } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } \\setminus h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ represents removing the element $h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ from the set $H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ . Totally, the contrastive learning in two spaces is calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal { L } _ { c t r } = \\mathcal { L } _ { t r u t h } + \\mathcal { L } _ { s e m } .\n$$\n\nOwing to the introduced contrastive learning, truthful space captures truthful features and can probe truth/untruth representations, while the semantic space captures semantic features.\n\nTruthfulness Editing After mapping the internal representations of LLM into the truthful and semantic space, TruthX aims to edit the latent representations in the truthful space and reconstruct the corresponding representations. To enhance TruthX\u2019s ability to reconstruct from edited latent representations, we introduce an editing loss. Specifically, for a pair of $( x ^ { p o s } , x ^ { n e g } )$ with opposite truthfulness, we exchange their latent representations in the truthful space $h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } \\Leftrightarrow h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ and reconstruct $( x ^ { n e g } , x ^ { p o s } )$ respectively via the decoder, represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r } { x ^ { p o s  n e g } { = } \\mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } { + } \\mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } , h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) ) , } \\\\ { x ^ { n e g  p o s } { = } \\mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } { + } \\mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } , h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) ) . } \\end{array}\n$$\n\n$x ^ { p o s  n e g }$ is reconstructed from $h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ and $h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ i.e., altering truthfulness from positive to negative, so the reconstructed representation is expected to be close to $x ^ { n e g }$ . Similarly, $x ^ { n e g  p o s }$ should be close to $x ^ { p o s }$ . Therefore, the editing loss $\\mathcal { L } _ { e d i t }$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathcal { L } _ { e d i t } = \\mathrm { M S E } ( x ^ { n e g } , x ^ { p o s \\to n e g } ) } \\\\ { + \\mathrm { M S E } ( x ^ { p o s } , x ^ { n e g \\to p o s } ) . } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nWith editing loss, TruthX can adjust the truthfulness by editing the latent representations in the truthful space. Totally, the training objective $\\mathcal { L }$ of TruthX consists of reconstruction loss, contrastive learning and editing loss:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal { L } = \\mathcal { L } _ { r e c o n } + \\mathcal { L } _ { c t r } + \\mathcal { L } _ { e d i t } .\n$$\n\nAfter training, truthful and untruthful representations exhibit distinct distributions in the truthful space. We aim to identify a truthful editing direction within this space, which points from the center of untruthful representations to the center of truthful representations. Formally, the truthful editing direction $\\delta \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { l a t e n t } }$ is calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\delta = \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } - \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ,\n$$\n\nwher e Hpos truth an d Hneg truth are the average representations in truthful space of all truthful samples and untruthful samples in the entire dataset.\n\n# 3.3 Editing in Truthful Space\n\nDuring inference, TruthX maps internal representations $x$ within LLM into truthful spaces $h _ { t r u t h }$ and semantic spaces $h _ { s e m }$ , and then edits the latent representations $h _ { t r u t h }$ in the truthful space, thereby enhancing the truthfulness of LLM. Specifically, given the trained edit direction $\\delta \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { l a t e n t } }$ in truthful space, TruthX converts it to the editing direction $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { m o d e l } }$ within the representation space of $x$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\Delta = \\mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } + \\mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } , h _ { t r u t h } + \\delta ) ) } \\\\ { - \\mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } + \\mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } , h _ { t r u t h } - \\delta ) ) . } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nThen, TruthX edits the internal representations $x$ along direction $\\Delta$ :\n\n$$\n{ \\hat { x } } = x + \\alpha \\times \\Delta ,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a scalar of editing strength. Finally, TruthX puts the representation $\\hat { x }$ back to LLM. In practice, TruthX edits the LLM\u2019s internal representations on the selected top $k$ layers from all attention and FFN layers based on the probing accuracy of each layer on the validation set. For instance, for a 32-layer LLM and $k = 1 0$ , TruthX selects the top 10 modules with the highest probing accuracy out of the total 64 modules (32 attention modules $^ +$ 32 FFN modules) to edit LLM.\n\n# 4 Experiments\n\n# 4.1 Datasets\n\nWe conduct experiments on the TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, TriviaQA and FACTOR (news, expert, wiki) benchmarks.\n\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) is the most widely used benchmark for assessing LLMs\u2019 truthfulness, comprising 817 questions across 38 categories. TruthfulQA encompasses two tasks: multiplechoice and open-ended generation. In multiplechoice task, LLM selects an answer from multiple correct/incorrect options, evaluated through multiple-choice accuracy (MC1, MC2 and MC3). In open-ended generation task, LLM directly generates the answer. Following the standard procedure on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), we employ two fine-tuned GPT-3 models to judge whether the answer is truthful and informative, denoted as True $( \\% )$ and Info $( \\% )$ respectively, while the product True\\*Info $( \\% )$ serves as the primary metric. The calculations of metrics are reported in Appendix C.\n\nNatural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), FACTOR (news, expert, wiki) (Muhlgay et al., 2023) are benchmarks for question answering, reading comprehension and factuality evaluation. We directly employ the well-trained TruthX model (trained on TruthfulQA data) on these benchmarks to assess TruthX\u2019s outof-distribution generalizability. Following Li et al. (2023b) and Chuang et al. (2023), all benchmarks are presented in a multiple-choice format and evaluated the choosing accuracy in closed-book setting.\n\n# 4.2 Baselines\n\nWe compare TruthX with the following methods.\n\nBaseline The original Llama-2-7B-Chat model (Touvron et al., 2023b).\n\nSupervised Finetuning Following Li et al. (2023b), the model is supervised finetuned on truthful QA pairs and Open Web Text.\n\nContrastive Decoding We involve CD (Li et al., 2023c), DoLa (Chuang et al., 2023), SH2 (Kai et al., 2024) and ICD (Zhang et al., 2023b), which respectively enhance the truthfulness of LLM by applying contrastive decoding on the output probabilities of strong/weak models, different layer outputs, different tokens, and truthful/illusion models.\n\nRepresentation Editing The state-of-the-art methods for enhancing LLM\u2019s truthfulness through editing internal representations, including ContrastConsistent Search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023), Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) (Li et al., 2023b), and Truth Forest (TrFr) (Chen et al., 2024), all learn a direction within attention heads and accordingly edit attention patterns of LLM.\n\nTruthX The proposed method.\n\nAll methods apply the standard settings of TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022). The results of contrastive decoding methods are derived from replications of Kai et al. (2024) and (Zhang et al., 2023b). The results of ITI and TrFr are our replications based on their publicly-available models and outputs.\n\nConfiguration In TruthX, the truthful encoder and semantic encoder consist of 2-layer MLPs with dimensions $[ 4 0 9 6 \\to 2 0 4 8$ , $2 0 4 8  1 0 2 4 ]$ , and the decoder consists of 2-layer MLPs with dimensions [ $1 0 2 4 \\to 2 0 4 8$ , $2 0 4 8 \\to 4 0 9 6 $ ]. The specific structure is presented in Appendix A. Following Li et al. (2023b) and Chen et al. (2024), we employ a 2-fold validation on TruthfulQA to ensure no overlap between training and testing. For training, TruthX is optimized using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. Based on the performance on validation set, we set the number of editing layers $k = 1 0$ and the editing strength $\\alpha { = } 1 . 0$ and $\\alpha { = } 4 . 5$ for the open-ended generation and multiple-choice task.\n\n# 4.3 Main Results\n\nResults on TruthfulQA Table 1 presents the comparison between TruthX and previous methods on TruthfulQA, where TruthX achieves the best results in both open-ended generation and multiplechoice tasks, yielding about $33 \\%$ and $20 \\%$ improvements over Llama-2-7B-Chat in True\\*Info score and MC1, respectively. Compared to contrastive decoding methods, TruthX directly enhances truthfulness within the internal representations during decoding and does not require extra models or decoding twice (Zhang et al., 2023b), thereby improving truthfulness in a more efficient way.\n\nTable 1: Results on TruthfulQA open-ended generation (True\\*Info $\\%$ ) and multiple-choice tasks $( \\mathrm { M C } \\% )$   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Methods</td><td colspan=\"3\">Open-ended Generation</td><td colspan=\"3\">Multiple-Choice</td></tr><tr><td>True (%)</td><td>Info (%)</td><td>True*Info (%)</td><td>MC1 (%)</td><td>MC2 (%)</td><td>MC3 (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Llama-2-7B-Chat</td><td>36.96</td><td>86.29</td><td>31.90</td><td>34.64</td><td>51.31</td><td>25.10</td></tr><tr><td>Supervised Finetuning</td><td>47.10</td><td>76.65</td><td>36.10</td><td>24.20</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Contrastive Decoding</td></tr><tr><td>CD (Li et al., 2023c)</td><td>55.30</td><td>80.29</td><td>44.40</td><td>24.40</td><td>41.00</td><td>19.00</td></tr><tr><td>DoLa (Chuang et al., 2023)</td><td>42.10</td><td>98.30</td><td>41.38</td><td>32.20</td><td>63.80</td><td>32.10</td></tr><tr><td>SH2 (Kai et al., 2024)</td><td>64.38</td><td>65.59</td><td>42.23</td><td>33.90</td><td>57.07</td><td>29.79</td></tr><tr><td>ICD (Zhang et al., 2023b)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>46.32</td><td>69.08</td><td>41.25</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Representation Editing</td></tr><tr><td>CSS (Burns et al., 2023)</td><td>34.70</td><td>96.25</td><td>33.40</td><td>26.20</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>ITI (Li et al., 2023b)</td><td>41.74</td><td>77.72</td><td>32.44</td><td>34.64</td><td>51.55</td><td>25.32</td></tr><tr><td>TrFr (Chen et al., 2024)</td><td>67.44</td><td>80.91</td><td>54.56</td><td>36.70</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>TruthX</td><td>72.95</td><td>89.72</td><td>65.45</td><td>54.22</td><td>73.90</td><td>44.37</td></tr></table>\n\nTable 2: Accuracy on Natural Questions, TriviaQA and FACTOR (news, expert and wiki) multiple-choice tasks, with Llama-2-7B-Chat as the baseline.   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Methods</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Natural Questions</td><td rowspan=\"2\">TriviaQA</td><td colspan=\"3\">FACTOR</td></tr><tr><td>news</td><td>expert</td><td>wiki</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline</td><td>54.90</td><td>66.75</td><td>64.67</td><td>64.83</td><td>56.95</td></tr><tr><td>ITI</td><td>57.83</td><td>65.95</td><td>53.28</td><td>51.69</td><td>43.82</td></tr><tr><td>TruthX</td><td>59.60</td><td>66.79</td><td>65.83</td><td>65.25</td><td>57.18</td></tr></table>\n\nCompared to the state-of-the-art ITI and TrFr, TruthX demonstrates significant advantages, primarily stemming from two reasons. First, different from ITI and TrFr intervening in attention heads to enhance truthfulness in attention patterns, TruthX edits the internal representations from attention and FFN modules, thereby enhancing truthfulness more comprehensively (Geva et al., 2021). Besides, intervening attention pattern often leads to noninformative responses like \u201cI have no comment.\u201d (187/817 for ITI, 144/817 for TrFr), thereby reducing the informativeness (Info $\\%$ ) (Li et al., 2023b). TruthX does not exhibit this tendency (only 87/817 for TruthX), instead, TruthX always produces more rigorous responses, thereby achieving even higher informativeness $( 8 9 . 7 2 \\% )$ compared to the baseline. Second, rather than directly edit the representations of LLM, TruthX maps them to semantic and truthful spaces and performs editing in the truthful space, thereby averting the impact on generation ability. This allows TruthX to perform stronger editing across more layers of LLM, thereby achieving a more significant enhancement.\n\nGeneralizability across more Benchmarks Table 2 illustrates TruthX\u2019s performance across more benchmarks, where we directly use the TruthX model trained on TruthfulQA to assess its out-of-distribution generalization. The results indicate that TruthX does not disrupt the LLM\u2019s performance when transferred to entirely new domains, and in some domains with strong relevance to real-world truthfulness (such as Natural Questions and FACTOR-news), TruthX even achieves some improvements. TruthX exhibits stronger generalization among various domains, primarily due to editing LLM only in truthful space without compromising their semantics and generative ability.\n\n# 4.4 Results on More LLMs\n\nTo validate the effectiveness across various LLMs, we apply TruthX to 13 advanced LLMs and show the improvements on TruthfulQA benchmark in Figure 3. For LLMs of different sizes such as Llama-2-7B-Chat (hidden dim is 4096) and Llama2-13B-Chat (hidden dim is 5120), TruthX consistently enhances the truthfulness. When applied to different LLMs, TruthX enhances all their truthfulness, yielding average improvements of $20 \\%$ in True\\*Info score and $15 \\%$ in MC1 accuracy. This highlights the versatility of TruthX across different LLMs. Promisingly, TruthX can elevate the MC1 of most 7B LLMs to surpass that of ChatGPT, approaching the level of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023).\n\n![](images/ee1041d184a5fe320aead07c344b88cf8e62e9943a20758b853b2fab3704289d.jpg)  \n(a) TruthfulQA multiple-choice task (MC1 $\\%$ )\n\n![](images/c00a15133678658b8a92596ddca510fb3abd31b71dbc0f559f71380878bc5da0.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Improvements of TruthX brought to various LLMs on TruthfulQA benchmark.\n\nTable 3: Ablation study of TruthX on TruthfulQA multiple-choice task. \u2018w/o select same token\u2019: using all tokens rather than the same token in $A ^ { p o s } / A ^ { n e g }$ for training; \u2018w/o semantic space\u2019: removing the semantic space; \u2018w/o attention operation\u2019 removing the attention in Eq.(2) and using add operation; \u2018w/o $\\mathcal { L } _ { c t r }$ , w/o $\\mathcal { L } _ { e d i t } ,$ : removing contrastive learning or editing loss.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Methods</td><td>MC1(%)</td><td>MC2(%)</td><td>MC3(%)</td></tr><tr><td>Llama-2-7B-Chat</td><td>34.64</td><td>51.31</td><td>25.10</td></tr><tr><td>TruthX</td><td>54.22</td><td>73.90</td><td>44.37</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Data Construction</td></tr><tr><td>w/o select same token</td><td>41.62</td><td>63.86</td><td>33.63</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Architecture</td></tr><tr><td>w/o semantic space</td><td>43.70</td><td>62.16</td><td>32.86</td></tr><tr><td>w/o attention operation</td><td>44.19</td><td>62.78</td><td>33.31</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Training Objective</td></tr><tr><td>w/o Lctr</td><td>34.64</td><td>51.29</td><td>25.12</td></tr><tr><td>w/o Ledit</td><td>45.41</td><td>63.40</td><td>35.19</td></tr></table>\n\n# 5 Analyses\n\nWe conduct extensive analyses to investigate the specific improvements of TruthX.

For data construction, using those tokens that appear in both truthful/untruthful answers mitigates the interference in probe learning caused by divergent semantics. Furthermore, modeling semantic and truthful latent representations separately and merging them through attention operation also demonstrates effectiveness.\n\n# 5.2 Superiority of Editing in Truthful Space\n\nTruthfulness Direction To ascertain whether TruthX learns reasonable truthfulness direction $\\delta$ in truthful space, we compare the effects of editing LLM along different directions in Table 4. The results indicate that editing within the semantic space does not influence LLM\u2019s truthfulness, while editing in truthful space directly determines truthfulness, where editing with $\\delta$ brings $20 \\%$ MC1 improvements and editing with $- \\delta$ results in a $19 \\%$ MC1 drop. Moreover, \u2018Random $\\delta ^ { \\ast }$ and \u2018Orthogonal $\\delta ^ { \\bullet }$ have negligible effect on truthfulness, suggesting that TruthX indeed identifies a direction for truthfulness in the truthful space. Table 5 gives examples of editing with $\\pm \\delta$ , demonstrating TruthX\u2019s capability to control the truthfulness of LLM.\n\nTable 5: Case study of TruthX, showing the generation results of editing LLM with $\\pm \\delta$ in truthful space respectively.

Naturally, Llama-2-Chat\u2019s generation results evaluated by itself yield the lowest PPL. Compared to editing in truthful space, editing in semantic space resulted in numerous outliers with significantly higher PPL (generating repetitive or anomalous tokens), which adversely affect the generative capability (Brown et al., 2023). This observation suggests that the semantic space captures more features relevant to semantics and generative capability. Owing to decoupling the truthful and semantic spaces, TruthX fulfills our motivation of enhancing truthfulness without damaging generative capability of LLM.\n\n<table><tr><td>Layers k \\ Strength \u03b1</td><td>-1.0</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.5</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>k = 1</td><td>27.11</td><td>31.29</td><td>32.40</td><td>35.66</td></tr><tr><td>k = 5</td><td>8.57</td><td>50.45</td><td>56.81</td><td>62.72</td></tr><tr><td>k = 10</td><td>7.71</td><td>51.70</td><td>59.47</td><td>65.45</td></tr></table>\n\nTable 6: True\\*Info $( \\% )$ of TruthX with various editing strength $\\alpha$ and layers $k$ . $\\alpha { = } { - } 1 . 0$ means negative editing.\n\nVisualization of Latent Spaces For a more intuitive depiction of the truthful and semantic spaces in TruthX, we reduce the latent representations of samples $X ^ { p o s }$ and $X ^ { n e g }$ from the validation set to 2 dimensions using t-SNE and visualize their kernel density estimate distributions in Figure 5. Truthful and untruthful samples exhibit similar distributions in semantic space, while they are distinctly separated in truthful space, which indicates that TruthX can effectively probe the truthfulness of representations in truthful spaces, further editing truthfulness.\n\n# 5.3 Effect of Editing Layers and Strength\n\nTable 6 reports the generation performance of editing the LLM at different numbers of layers $( k )$ and strengths $\\alpha$ . As the number of edited layers and the editing strength increase, TruthX progressively enhances the truthfulness of the LLM\u2019s outputs.\n\n![](images/6f65ab2d936d560a333947d45992ddf83728e1af43bc4b0764624f4c6417001e.jpg)  \nFigure 6: TruthfulQA MC1 accuracy (numerical values) of directly applying the TruthX model trained on one LLM (horizontal axis) to different LLMs (vertical axis). The color (values in parentheses) indicates the improvement compared to the baseline. LLMs labeled with the same superscript are homologous.\n\n# 5.4 Generalizability of Truthful Space among LLMs\n\nTo assess the feasibility of directly applying the TruthX model trained on one LLM to other LLMs, we evaluate the cross-LLM generalization of the TruthX model, as illustrated in Figure 6. The LLMs utilized in our investigation have approximately 7 billion parameters, with the same internal representation dimensions of 4096.\n\nOur findings reveal that TruthX demonstrates robust generalization across homologous LLMs, i.e., those models trained sequentially with different stages or additional data. Specifically, Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), fine-tuned from Llama-1 (Touvron et al., 2023a), exhibits strong TruthX generalization akin to Llama-1. Similarly, Llama-2- Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b) and Vicuna-v1.5 (Chiang et al., 2023) are progressively fine-tuned from Llama-2, and TruthX can be directly applied across these three models to enhance truthfulness. The same phenomenon also occurs in Mistral, Baichuan and Chatglm. This observation suggests that the truthful space learned by TruthX and the direction of truthfulness editing are predominantly determined by the pre-training stage, with subsequent fine-tuning exerting minimal impact due to the relatively limited amount of training data. Efficiently, if a model is fine-tuned from Llama-2-Chat, TruthX trained on Llama-2-Chat can be directly used to (b) TruthfulQA MC1 accuracy of editing only one attention or FFN module.\n\n![](images/78d3cb620c581067873ce6ae7b6276b8342d5b9dbb5d1d9108aa77e7dbce2f30.jpg)  \n(a) Probing accuracy on each attention and FFN module.\n\n![](images/9b3de22aa8e05b51204acd203b3cd52d98c87740f1918e5861657b7f65069a04.jpg)  \nFigure 7: Probing accuracy and MC1 of each layer.\n\nimprove its truthfulness without extra training.\n\n# 5.5 Probing Accuracy across Layers\n\nTo explore the truthfulness across layers within LLM, we compute the probing accuracy (refer to Eq.(15)) of TruthX at each layer in the validation set and MC1 score when editing each individual layer. As depicted in Figure 7, we observe that the LLMs after alignments (Ouyang et al., 2022), exhibit higher probing accuracy compared to those LLMs without alignments such as Llama-1 (Touvron et al., 2023a) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). This suggests that the truthfulness in representations after alignment is more discernible by TruthX. Besides, among 32 layers, intermediate layers (10- 20) demonstrate higher probing accuracy and MC1 improvements, indicating a stronger correlation with truthfulness, which is consistent with previous findings (Li et al., 2023b; Geva et al., 2021). Besides, we find that the probing accuracy of attention and FFN is comparable, further affirming the motivation that TruthX probes all internal representations instead of only attention or FFN. Overall, TruthX achieves approximately $90 \\%$ probing accuracy at some layers, highlighting its effectiveness.\n\n# 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we propose TruthX, which enhances truthfulness by editing LLM in truthful space. We do not claim that TruthX guarantees LLMs will consistently generate truthful responses; rather, it aims to elicit LLMs to produce responses more truthfully. Promising results demonstrate that TruthX is a step towards truthfulness in the field of LLMs.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and valuable comments.

The motivation of TruthX is to elicit truthfulness in a well-trained LLM, encouraging it to generate outputs that faithfully reflect its learned world knowledge. TruthX does not possess the capability to create new knowledge out of thin air and inject it into LLM, thus exhibiting limitations in cases where the required knowledge lies beyond the scope of LLM training stages. Therefore, the potential of TruthX lies in collaborating with external knowledge to collectively mitigate the hallucinations of LLM from both internal and external perspectives. We leave this to future work, further advancing towards reliable LLMs.\n\nWei-Lin Chiang, Zhuohan Li, Zi Lin, Ying Sheng, Zhanghao Wu, Hao Zhang, Lianmin Zheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Yonghao Zhuang, Joseph E.

The truthful and semantic encoders map the input representation $x$ into a latent representation. The first layer maps $x$ to a 2048-dimensional representation, and the second layer further reduces it to a 1024- dimensional latent representation. Subsequently, the truthful and semantic latent representations are fused according to Eq.(2). Finally, the decoder\u2019s first layer maps the fused 1024-dimensional latent representation back to 2048 dimensions, and then restores it to the same dimensions as $x$ .\n\nTraining Following Li et al. (2023b) and Chen et al. (2024), we employ a 2-fold validation on TruthfulQA benchmark. Specifically, half of the questions (408 samples) with one correct and one incorrect response are allocated for training and validation of TruthX, while the remaining half is used for testing. The training and validation sets are randomly split in a 3:1 ratio.\n\n# B Expanded Analyses\n\n# B.1 Category-wise Improvements of TruthX\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the specific improvements achieved by TruthX across the 38 hallucination categories covered in TruthfulQA benchmark. TruthX\n\nconsistently enhances the truthfulness of LLM across all types of questions.\n\n# B.2 Dimensions of Latent Space\n\nTo explore the performance of TruthX with latent representations of varying dimensions, we present the results on TruthfulQA using different dimensions of latent representations in Table 7. The findings demonstrate that latent representations spanning from 64 to 2048 dimensions all contribute to enhancing the truthfulness of LLMs through editing within the truthful space. Specifically, when the latent representations decrease to 64 dimensions, a slight decrease in TruthX performance is observed, primarily manifested in a drop in informativeness (resulting in more occurrences of \u201cI have no comment.\u201d, 147 of 817). This suggests that higher-dimensional latent representations empower TruthX to execute more nuanced editing within the truthful space, rather than simply resorting to a uniform \u201cI have no comment.\u201d.\n\n# B.3 Data Size for TruthX Training\n\nTo analyze the impact of training data size on TruthX, we present the performance of TruthX on TruthfulQA open-ended generation tasks under various training data size conditions, as depicted in Figure 9. Specifically, we vary the total data size used for training and validation from $50 \\%$ (i.e., 408 samples) down to $5 \\%$ (i.e., 40 samples), while maintaining a consistent 3:1 split between training and validation sets. The results reveal a slight decrease in TruthX performance as the data size decreases. Importantly, even with only $5 \\%$ of the data, corresponding to 40 samples for training and validation (30 samples for training and 10 samples for validation), TruthX can elevate the True\\*Info $( \\% )$ of Llama-2-7B-Chat from $3 1 . 9 0 \\%$ to $6 3 . 7 7 \\%$ showcasing the lightweight and practical advantages of TruthX.\n\nTable 7: Performance of TruthX with different dimensions of latent representations on TruthfulQA benchmark. We employ truthful and semantic encoders of varying sizes to map the internal representations of LLMs to latent representations of different dimensions. The decoder utilizes a dimension mapping that is the reverse of the encoder.   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\">Methods</td><td colspan=\"3\">Open-ended Generation</td><td colspan=\"3\">Multiple-Choice</td></tr><tr><td>True (%)</td><td>Info (%)</td><td>True*Info (%)</td><td>MC1 (%)</td><td>MC2 (%)</td><td>MC3 (%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Baseline</td><td>36.96</td><td>86.29</td><td>31.90</td><td>34.64</td><td>51.31</td><td>25.10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">TruthX</td><td>[4096 \u2192 512, 512\u219264]</td><td>78.58</td><td>80.91</td><td>63.58</td><td>51.16</td><td>69.69</td><td>40.94</td></tr><tr><td>[4096 \u2192 1024, 1024 \u2192 512]</td><td>75.76</td><td>88.86</td><td>67.33</td><td>53.12</td><td>70.79</td><td>43.38</td></tr><tr><td>[4096 \u2192 2048, 2048 \u2192 1024]</td><td>72.95</td><td>89.72</td><td>65.45</td><td>54.22</td><td>73.90</td><td>44.37</td></tr><tr><td>[4096 \u2192 3072, 3072\u2192 2048]</td><td>72.58</td><td>86.41</td><td>62.72</td><td>51.16</td><td>70.20</td><td>41.33</td></tr></table>\n\n![](images/1b8cd211823e28a2415768e09b01c833051071c252471d77823b66e1528000bd.jpg)  \nFigure 9: Performance of TruthX trained with various data sizes on TruthfulQA open-ended generation. The results are averaged over 3 runs.\n\n# B.4 Visualization of Probing on Internal Representations\n\nIn Figures 10 and 11, we visualize the internal representations of the LLM probed by TruthX. Specifically, TruthX maps the internal representations $x$ of LLM to the truthful space $h _ { t r u t h }$ and calculates the distance between $h _ { t r u t h }$ and the center of truthful representations $\\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ , subtracting the distance between them and the center of untruthful representations H truth $( \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ and $\\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ refer to Eq.(12)). Formally, the probing of internal representations $x$ in truthful space is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { P r o b e } \\left( \\boldsymbol { x } \\right) = p o s , } \\\\ & { \\qquad \\mathrm { i f } \\ s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) \\geq s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { P r o b e } \\left( \\boldsymbol { x } \\right) = n e g , } \\\\ & { \\qquad \\mathrm { i f } \\ s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) < s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $s i m ( \\cdot , \\cdot )$ is cosine similarity, $h _ { t r u t h } ~ =$ TruthEnc $( x )$ is the latent representations of $x$ in truthful space.\n\nAs shown in Figures 10 and 11, TruthX effectively probes the internal representations of LLM in the truthful space, where the latent representations of truthful answers tend to be closer to $\\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ while those of untruthful answers are closer to $\\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ . Particularly in the case of Figure 10, when LLM generates the incorrect token \u201clanguage\u201d, its internal representation is the most illusionary. Similarly, in Figure 11, after generating \u201cLow calorie\u201d, due to the constraints of autoregressive generation, LLM can only continue to \u201cfabricate\u201d the following content, resulting in the entire generation process being filled with illusions. Overall, TruthX demonstrates effective probing of truthfulness within the truthful space.\n\n# C Evaluation of TruthfulQA\n\nTruthfulQA is a benchmark specifically designed to entice the model to produce hallucinatory answers. TruthfulQA comprises 817 questions, each accompanied by one best answer, several correct answers and several incorrect answers. The TruthfulQA benchmark encompasses both open-ended generation and multiple-choice tasks. Below, we will introduce the two tasks and their corresponding metrics.\n\nOpen-ended Generation The model generates responses to questions directly using greedy decoding. Following the standard practice on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Chen et al., (a) Truthful answer: People cannot learn in their sleep.\n\n![](images/c39349d340ffd98a06cb5010c31572affba5524053bf72d7f93a059ef0f8acd0.jpg)  \n(b) Untruthful answer: People can learn languages in their sleep.\n\n![](images/c1285fbdd1fa4645e4a6a07eb025eb44f0de80321a1e34eac74e84860b6b68af.jpg)\n\nFigure 10: Visualization of probing LLM\u2019s internal representations, showing case 602 in TruthfulQA benckmark. Question: We now have scientific evidence that some people can learn what in their sleep?. We illustrate the process of an LLM generating the next token, where the vertical axis from top to bottom represents the internal representations from the attention and FFN modules from the 1st layer to the 32nd layer. The tokens inside the boxes represent the tokens decoded from the current internal representation using the final lm_head of the LLM. The colors denote the probing results in the truthful space, with blue indicating proximity to the center of truthful representations and red indicating proximity to the center of untruthful representations.\n\n![](images/9459cdd088a74aca7d9209a8207f325f2db9ca398d3c54e08783321af0c525a2.jpg)  \n(a) Truthful answer: No diet has been scientifically proven to (b) Untruthful answer: Low calorie diets are scientifically keep working for everyone who tries it. proven to keep working for everyone who tries them.\n\n![](images/4c72b5779193ff33cb124948d80bb4b01175037d75e07caf69ac731c10d01d8d.jpg)  \nFigure 11: Visualization of probing LLM\u2019s internal representations, showing case 494 in TruthfulQA benckmark.

The metrics for open-ended generation tasks include True $( \\% )$ , Info $( \\% )$ and True\\*Info $( \\% )$ which are calculated as:\n\n\u2022 True $( \\% )$ : the percentage of responses that are deemed truthful.   \n\u2022 Info $( \\% )$ : the percentage of responses that provide helpful information. Responses lacking substantive meaning, such as $^ { 6 6 } I$ have no comment.\u201d, are classified as lacking informativeness.   \n\u2022 True\\*Info $( \\% )$ : the product of True $( \\% )$ and Info $( \\% )$ , serving as a comprehensive measure for evaluating the truthfulness and informativeness of model responses.\n\nMultiple-choice The model selects an answer from multiple correct and incorrect options by comparing the conditional probabilities of candidate options given the question. Multiple-choice task is evaluated through multiple-choice accuracy (MC), which involves MC1, MC2 and MC3, calculated as:\n\n\u2022 MC1 $( \\% )$ : the proportion of instances where the model assigns the highest probabilities to the best answer.   \n\u2022 MC2 $( \\% )$ : the proportion of instances where the normalized probability mass for all correct answers is greater than that of the incorrect answers.   \n\u2022 MC3 $( \\% )$ the proportion of instances where all correct answers receive higher scores than all incorrect answers, i.e., the probability of all correct answers ranks before that of incorrect answers.\n\nFollowing the Standard setting from Lin et al.

OVERVIEW AND GOALS\n\n\u2022 Objective: Enhance the truthfulness of an existing large language model (LLM) by \u201cediting\u201d its internal representations in a dedicated \u201ctruthful space\u201d via an autoencoder that decouples semantic and truth\u2013related features.  \n\u2022 High-level approach:\n  \u2013 For a given question Q we have paired answers: a truthful answer (A\u208a) and an untruthful one (A\u208b).  \n  \u2013 Use those examples (only the tokens common to both answers to reduce semantic interference) to extract internal activations (from attention and FFN modules across transformer layers).  \n  \u2013 Map each hidden representation x \u2208 \u211d^(d_model) into two distinct latent spaces using two separate MLPs (one for truth [TruthEnc] and one for semantics [SemEnc]).  \n  \u2013 Combine the two latent representations using an attention operation and feed this combined representation into a decoder MLP.  \n  \u2013 Train the autoencoder using three loss terms:\n     \u25b8 Reconstruction loss (L_recon): MSE(x, x\u2032)\n     \u25b8 Contrastive loss (L_ctr): to force separation in the truthful space (and also differences in the semantic space)\n     \u25b8 Editing loss (L_edit): to enforce that swapping h_truth between truthful and untruthful samples recovers the opposite answer\n  \u2013 After training, compute a \u201ctruth\u2013editing direction\u201d \u03b4 in the truthful latent space (i.e. the difference between the means of h_truth for A\u208a and A\u208b).  \n  \u2013 At inference time, extract the internal representation from selected modules/layers, map them to latent space, edit h_truth using \u03b4 (scaled by a hyperparameter \u03b1 via a conversion mechanism back to the original representation space), and then inject the modified representations back into the LLM to steer generation toward more truthful responses.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. METHODOLOGY REPRODUCTION\n\nA. Data Preparation and Triplet Construction  \n   1. Dataset:  \n      \u2013 Use a subset of the TruthfulQA benchmark (or another suitable fact\u2013checking dataset).\n      \u2013 Split the data into two halves: one half for training/validation (using 3:1 split within this half) and one half reserved for testing (2\u2013fold validation is recommended to avoid overlap).  \n   2. Triplets:  \n      \u2013 For each sample, create a triplet: (Question, A\u208a, A\u208b) where A\u208a is a truthful (factually correct) answer and A\u208b is an untruthful answer (hallucinatory response generated by the baseline LLM).\n      \u2013 The paper suggests \u201cstimulating\u201d the LLM with both types of responses.\n   3. Token Selection:  \n      \u2013 Identify and restrict to only the tokens that appear in both A\u208a and A\u208b. This is intended to reduce the influence of divergent semantics.\n      \u2013 (Clarification needed: How exactly are \u201cshared tokens\u201d selected? One may match on string tokens using exact matching or a more forgiving matching strategy if tokenization discrepancies occur.)\n\nB. Internal Representation Extraction  \n   1. Instrument the target transformer-based LLM (e.g., Llama-2-7B-Chat) so that during a forward pass you capture hidden activations from:\n         \u2013 Each attention module\u2019s output.\n         \u2013 Each feed-forward (FFN) module\u2019s output.\n   2. For every training sample:\n         \u2013 Run a forward pass twice\u2014one when the LLM generates A\u208a and one with A\u208b.\n         \u2013 Extract the activations (x) for every module and then select only those corresponding to the common tokens (matching indices).\n   3. Probing:  \n         \u2013 Evaluate each module (or layer) to \u201cprobe\u201d how well its activations can distinguish between truthful and untruthful outputs.  \n         \u2013 Identify the top k modules (e.g., top 10 modules out of the total 64 possible modules for a 32\u2011layer LLM) based on this probing accuracy.\n         \u2013 (Clarification: The exact definition of \u201cprobing accuracy\u201d is not fully spelled out in the paper. You might use a simple linear classifier trained on the latent features to separate A\u208a from A\u208b examples.)\n\nC. Autoencoder Architecture  \n   1. Input: x \u2208 \u211d^(d_model) (for example, d_model = 4096 for Llama-2-7B-Chat).\n   2. Two distinct encoders:\n         \u2013 Truthful Encoder \u201cTruthEnc\u201d: a 2-layer MLP mapping x \u2192 h_truth \u2208 \u211d^(d_latent) (e.g., 4096 \u2192 2048 then 2048 \u2192 1024).\n         \u2013 Semantic Encoder \u201cSemEnc\u201d: a similar 2-layer MLP mapping x \u2192 h_sem \u2208 \u211d^(d_latent).\n         \u2013 Use ReLU activations after each fully connected layer.\n   3. Attention-based fusion:\n         \u2013 Compute an attention operation Attn( h_sem, h_truth ). (Clarification needed: Which attention mechanism? Likely dot-product attention with a fixed temperature/scaling.)\n         \u2013 Combine: fused = h_sem + Attn( h_sem, h_truth ).\n   4. Decoder (\u201cDec\u201d):\n         \u2013 Another 2-layer MLP that maps fused latent representation back to the original representation space: Dec(fused) \u2192 x\u2032 \u2208 \u211d^(d_model). For example: 1024 \u2192 2048 then 2048 \u2192 4096.\n   5. Training loss: \n         \u2013 Reconstruction loss L_recon = MSE( x, x\u2032 ).\n\nD. Contrastive Loss  \n   1. For each latent representation in the truthful space:\n         \u2013 Construct a positive set S\u207a (representations from samples with the same truth status) and a negative set S\u207b (representations with the opposite truth status).\n   2. Use the contrastive loss formula (similar to ones used in metric learning) with cosine similarity and a temperature parameter \u03c4 = 0.1.\n         \u2013 Loss L_ctr = ContrastiveLoss( h_truth, S\u207a, S\u207b ).\n   3. Do similar contrastive learning in the semantic space to ensure that h_sem mainly captures token semantics.\n   4. (Clarification: The exact structure of the contrastive loss\u2014for example, whether you consider noise\u2013contrastive estimation over the batch\u2014is not fully specified. One may adopt a standard InfoNCE loss formulation.)\n\nE. Editing Loss  \n   1. For a pair of samples (x from A\u208a and x from A\u208b that are paired via common tokens):\n         \u2013 Swap their latent truthful representations.\n         \u2013 Feed the swapped latent code, along with the corresponding h_sem, through the decoder.\n         \u2013 The decoder\u2019s output should approximate the original representation of the opposite truth type.  \n         \u2013 Define L_edit = MSE( x_(A\u208b), Dec( h_sem^(A\u208a) + Attn( h_sem^(A\u208a), h_truth^(A\u208b) ) ) ) + MSE( x_(A\u208a), Dec( h_sem^(A\u208b) + Attn( h_sem^(A\u208b), h_truth^(A\u208a) ) ) ).\n   2. This enforces that the autoencoder can \u201cflip\u201d the truth direction when swapping latent representations.\n\nF. Total Loss and Training Procedure  \n   1. Total Loss L = L_recon + L_ctr + L_edit.\n   2. Optimizer: Use Adam with learning rate 1e-4.\n   3. Training schedule: Run full training until convergence (monitor validation reconstruction accuracy and probing accuracy).  \n   4. Save checkpoints including the parameters of TruthEnc, SemEnc, and Dec.\n\nG. Computing the Truthful Editing Direction  \n   1. For all training examples, compute:\n         \u03b4 = Mean( h_truth for all A\u208a samples ) \u2212 Mean( h_truth for all A\u208b samples ).\n   2. This \u03b4 serves as the editing \u201cdirection\u201d in the truthful latent space.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. INFERENCE TIME & REPRESENTATION EDITING\n\nA. Embedding Editing Mechanism  \n   1. For each new input during generation:\n         \u2013 For the selected modules and layers (top k, as identified from probing) capture the current internal representation x.\n         \u2013 Map x to h_truth and h_sem using the pre-trained TruthEnc and SemEnc.\n   2. Convert the editing direction:\n         \u2013 The paper proposes a conversion step, e.g. computing \u0394 in the model\u2019s representation space by comparing:\n              \u0394 = Dec( h_sem + Attn( h_sem, h_truth + \u03b4 ) ) \u2013 Dec( h_sem + Attn( h_sem, h_truth \u2212 \u03b4 ) )\n         \u2013 (Clarification: This conversion might be refined based on experimental trials.)\n   3. Modify the representation:\n         \u2013 New representation: x\u0302 = x + \u03b1 \u00d7 \u0394, where \u03b1 is the editing strength.\n         \u2013 Hyperparameters: \u03b1 is set to 1.0 for open\u2013ended generation and \u03b1 = 4.5 for multiple\u2013choice tasks.\n   4. Inject x\u0302 back into the LLM\u2019s computation pipeline (overwrite the original activations in those modules) so that subsequent generation has been \u201csteered\u201d toward truthfulness.\n\nB. Which Layers to Edit  \n   1. Based on the earlier probing step, edit only the modules with the highest probing accuracy (e.g., top 10).\n   2. This helps limit interference to generation fluency.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n4.

Additional benchmarks for cross-domain evaluation:\n         \u2013 Natural Questions, TriviaQA, FACTOR (news, expert, wiki): Use closed\u2013book multiple\u2013choice settings.\n         \u2013 Evaluate using multiple\u2013choice accuracy (MC1, MC2, MC3).\n\nB.

Optimizer: Adam lr = 1e-4.\n   3. Editing hyperparameters:\n         \u2013 Number of layers (modules) to edit: k (for a 32\u2013layer model, k = 10 as in the paper).\n         \u2013 Editing strength \u03b1: e.g., 1.0 for open\u2013ended and 4.5 for multiple\u2013choice tasks.\n         \u2013 Temperature for contrastive loss: \u03c4 = 0.1.\n   4.

Open\u2013ended Generation:\n         \u2013 True (%) and Info (%) determined by external evaluators (the original used two fine\u2013tuned GPT\u20133 models \u201cGPT\u2013judge\u201d and \u201cGPT\u2013info\u201d). Alternatively, human evaluation or another automated proxy may be used.\n         \u2013 The product True*Info (%) is the primary metric.\n         \u2013 Perplexity on generated responses to ensure that generation quality (fluency) is not compromised.\n   2.

Ablation studies:\n         \u2013 Evaluate the removal of semantic space, of contrastive loss (L_ctr), of editing loss (L_edit), or using different attention mechanisms inside autoencoder.\n         \u2013 Compared editing directions: \u03b4 vs. \u2013\u03b4, random \u03b4, etc.\n   4.

POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES & CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED\n\n\u2022 The precise implementation of the attention operation in Eq.(2) (\u201cAttn( h_sem, h_truth )\u201d) is not fully detailed. Is it a dot\u2013product attention between h_sem (query) and h_truth (key/value) with softmax normalization?  \n\u2022 The construction of the positive and negative sets for the contrastive loss: Will you use the full batch or a memory bank?  \n\u2022 How exactly to \u201cinject\u201d the modified internal representation back into the LLM? This step will likely involve hooking into the model\u2019s forward function and overwriting the activation of a given module.  \n\u2022 The selection method for \u201cshared tokens\u201d between A\u208a and A\u208b might need experimentation if tokenization differences arise.\n\u2022 The interplay of the editing loss with contrastive and reconstruction losses may require tuning.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n6. ROADMAP SUMMARY\n\nStep\u2013by\u2013step:\n1. Prepare a triplet dataset from a subset of TruthfulQA (or similar) with paired truthful/untruthful answers.\n2. Modify the target LLM to capture internal representations (attention and FFN outputs) for only the tokens common to both answers.\n3. Build the autoencoder architecture (TruthEnc, SemEnc, Decoder) as 2\u2013layer MLPs (with ReLU) following the described dimensions.\n4. Define and implement the three loss functions (reconstruction, contrastive, and editing losses).  \n5. Train the autoencoder on the collected representations using Adam (lr = 1e\u20134), monitoring validation performance.\n6. Compute the editing direction \u03b4 from the latent truthful space.\n7. At inference, hook into the selected top k layers; for each module, encode the activation, compute \u0394 (via the conversion procedure) then update x\u0302 = x + \u03b1 \u00d7 \u0394.\n8. Insert these modified representations back into the LLM and generate responses.\n9. Evaluate on TruthfulQA (both open\u2013ended and MC tasks) and other benchmarks; perform ablations.\n10. Finally, explore cross\u2013model generalization and analyze the latent space distribution and layer\u2013wise probing accuracy.\n\nThis roadmap should provide a comprehensive strategy that covers the necessary implementation and experimental procedures. Further clarification on attention details, token matching, and injection mechanism should be resolved either by contacting the authors or through pilot experiments. Once this plan is agreed upon, the next step is to translate it into code.\n\n-----\n\n## Design\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    \"Implementation approach\": \"We will reproduce the paper's method using PyTorch and Huggingface Transformers. A baseline LLM (e.g., Llama-2-7B-Chat) will be instrumented with forward hooks to capture internal representations from its attention and FFN modules. We then build an autoencoder system that decouples the representations into two latent spaces via two separate 2-layer MLPs (TruthEnc for truth-related features and SemEnc for semantics). The two latent representations are fused using an attention mechanism and passed through a decoder to reconstruct the original activations. The training is done using a combined loss: a reconstruction MSE loss, a contrastive loss (with cosine similarity and temperature \u03c4 = 0.1) applied in both latent spaces, and an editing loss that enforces consistency when swapping the truthful latent codes between paired truthful/untruthful examples. Once trained, the system computes a truth-editing direction (\u03b4) from the difference between the means of truthful and untruthful latent codes. At inference, for the selected top k layers, we extract the LLM\u2019s internal activations, project them using our encoders, compute a conversion (\u0394) back to the original space based on the fused representation with h_truth \u00b1 \u03b4, and then modify the activations by adding \u03b1*\u0394.

Each test sample may include a question and its associated candidate answers (or ground\u2011truth triplets) for open\u2011ended generation and multiple\u2011choice evaluation.\n\u2003\u2013 A configuration dictionary (or the parsed config.yaml) that supplies hyperparameters such as d_model, number of editing layers (k_edit_layers), editing strengths for open\u2011ended and multiple\u2011choice tasks, and the temperature for contrastive loss (although the latter is more used during training).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. EVALUATION OF OPEN\u2010ENDED GENERATION TASKS\n\nThe Evaluation class will implement an evaluate_open_ended() method whose logic is as follows:\n\nA. For each test sample:\n\u20031. Retrieve the question Q (and possibly its expected \u201ctruthful\u201d answer for later diagnostic/reference).\n\u20032. Run the forward pass of the LLM:\n\u2003\u2003a. The base LLM\u2019s transformer modules (attention and FFN outputs) are captured using forward hooks.\n\u2003\u2003b. For the selected top k modules (as determined previously during training/probing), call the model\u2019s own method edit_representation(x, \u03b4, alpha) to modify the internal activations. (Here alpha will be chosen based on configuration; for open\u2011ended tasks, alpha = 1.0.)\n\u20033. Generate an answer by letting the model continue its decoding using its modified internal representations.\n\u20034. Save the generated answer text.\n\nB. Scoring the generated answer:\n\u2003\u2022 According to the paper, two external evaluators (e.g. fine\u2011tuned GPT\u20113 \u201cGPT-judge\u201d and \u201cGPT-info\u201d) are used to compute:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 True Percentage: Fraction of responses deemed factually correct or truthful.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Info Percentage: Fraction containing substantive, informative content (i.e. avoiding \u201cI have no comment.\u201d responses).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The product True*Info is then computed.\n\u2003\u2022 In our evaluation module, we assume that there are scoring functions (or simulated criteria) that return these percentages for the test set.\n\u2003\u2022 The Evaluation class aggregates scores over the test split and returns a results dictionary with keys \u201cTruePercentage\u201d, \u201cInfoPercentage\u201d, and \u201cTrueInfoProduct.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 (Optional diagnostic: Also compute the perplexity of the generated responses to ensure that generative fluency is not unduly compromised.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. EVALUATION OF MULTIPLE\u2011CHOICE TASKS\n\nThe Evaluation class will also contain an evaluate_multiple_choice() method that follows this outline:\n\nA. For each multiple-choice sample:\n\u20031. The sample will provide a question and candidate answer options (with one or more answers labeled \u201ccorrect\u201d according to the benchmark).\n\u20032. The model computes conditional probabilities for each candidate answer:\n\u2003\u2003a. Using forced decoding or log\u2013likelihood evaluation, the model scores each candidate answer.\n\u2003\u2003b. When editing is applied, the internal activations for the selected modules are modified via the edit_representation() method (here alpha is set to 4.5 as specified for multiple-choice tasks).\n\u20033. Compute evaluation metrics:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 MC1: Percentage of questions where the candidate with the highest probability is the verified best answer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 MC2: Proportion where the normalized probability mass for all correct answers exceeds that for incorrect ones.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 MC3: Proportion where all correct answer scores rank above all incorrect answer scores.\n\u20034.

RE\u2010INJECTION AND INTERNAL REPRESENTATION EDITING\n\nA key part of evaluation is to verify that the \u201cediting\u201d mechanism works at inference time. Therefore:\n\u2003\u2022 For each test sample (both open-ended and multiple-choice), before generating the final response or computing candidate probabilities, the Evaluation class will:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Obtain the internal representation \u201cx\u201d from the relevant transformer modules (using forward hooks).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use model.compute_latents(x) to produce (h_truth, h_sem).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Compute a fused representation using the attention fusion method (via model.fuse_latents) if needed.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use the pre-computed editing direction \u03b4 (obtained during training when the autoencoder was trained) and the model.edit_representation(x, \u03b4, alpha) method to produce the new modified activation x\u0302.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Inject x\u0302 back into the computation graph so that subsequent decoding/generation uses the edited state.\n\u2003\u2022 This process ensures that all evaluations are performed with the LLM\u2019s internal representations having been steered toward more truthful directions.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n5. DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUTS AND VISUALIZATIONS\n\nA. (Optional) The Evaluation class may include a method to generate diagnostic outputs such as:\n\u2003\u2022 Collecting latent representations (especially h_truth from the encoder) for a set of test samples.\n\u2003\u2022 Running a dimensionality reduction algorithm (such as t\u2011SNE) and plotting the resulting 2D embeddings.\n\u2003\u2022 These plots help to visually confirm that truthful and untruthful samples (or responses) are grouped separately in the truthful latent space.\n\u2003\u2022 Save these plots to files for later inspection.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n6. AGGREGATING RESULTS AND RETURN\n\nA. The main evaluate() method of the Evaluation class will call both:\n\u2003\u2013 evaluate_open_ended()\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003evaluate_multiple_choice()\n\u2003\u2022 The results from both tasks are combined into one dictionary (or printed side by side) for logging and comparison.\n\u2003\u2022 The method returns this dictionary so that the main script (main.py) can log, visualize, or further process the evaluation metrics.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n7. DEPENDENCIES AND INTERFACES\n\n\u2022 This module will depend on:\n\u2003\u2013 TruthXModel from model.py for methods:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 compute_latents(x): returns (h_truth, h_sem)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 fuse_latents(h_sem, h_truth)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 decode(fused) for reconstruction (if needed)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 edit_representation(x, \u03b4, alpha)\n\u2003\u2013 DatasetLoader (or its provided Dataset object) from dataset_loader.py to iterate over test samples.\n\u2022 It will also use utility functions (from utils.py) for:\n\u2003\u2022 Token matching possible in postprocessing.\n\u2003\u2022 Any custom attention fusion operations needed in diagnostic mode.\n\u2003\u2022 Standard PyTorch and, optionally, plotting libraries (e.g., matplotlib, scikit\u2011learn for t\u2011SNE) for diagnostics.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n8. POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES TO NOTE\n\n\u2022 The precise scoring procedure for True and Info metrics is not fully detailed in the paper; therefore, the Evaluation class should be designed to either interface with external evaluators (such as GPT-based scoring models) or to allow manual/human evaluation simulation.\n\u2022 The mechanism for \u201cinjecting\u201d the modified representations back into the LLM is critical. We assume that model.edit_representation() has been implemented correctly and that forward hooks have been established so that when the Evaluation class calls the model\u2019s generation function, the activations have already been modified.\n\u2022 The candidate selection and probability extraction process for multiple-choice tasks may need careful handling of tokenization (and possibly beam search or forced decoding) to correctly compute probability scores.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n9. SUMMARY FLOW (in pseudocode terms)\n\nThe evaluate() method roughly follows this outline:\n\u2003- For each open-ended test sample:\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Extract question Q.\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Run the LLM forward pass with editing (using edit_representation for top k layers with alpha = config.editing.open_ended).\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Generate answer and store the response.\n\u2003- After processing all samples, score the responses with functions that compute TruePercentage, InfoPercentage, and their product.\n\u2003- For each multiple-choice test sample:\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Feed question Q and candidate answers.\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 For each candidate, compute likelihood by running the forward pass (with edits applied, alpha = config.editing.multiple_choice).\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Rank candidates and update MC1, MC2, MC3 counts.\n\u2003- (Optional) Run t-SNE on latent representations from a subset and generate diagnostic plots.\n\u2003- Return a final dictionary containing all evaluation metrics.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis logic analysis for evaluation.py aligns with the paper\u2019s methodology and our design plan. It explicitly covers how the Evaluation class should use the pre-trained TruthXModel for both generation and modifying internal activations, how open-ended and multiple-choice evaluations are performed, and how diagnostic outputs can be generated. The analysis also highlights areas where further clarification is needed (such as the precise scoring functions and the re-injection mechanism). With this analysis, implementing evaluation.py should follow in a well-structured and reproducible way.\n\n"}]
