# Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes suffer from producing hallucinations, especially LLMs may generate untruthful responses despite knowing the correct knowledge. Activating the truthfulness within LLM is the key to fully unlocking LLM’s knowledge potential. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inference-time intervention method to activate the truthfulness of LLM by identifying and editing the features within LLM’s internal representations that govern the truthfulness. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM’s representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM’s internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLM. Experiments show that TruthX improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of $20 \%$ on TruthfulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that TruthX can control LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses via editing only one vector in LLM’s internal representations1.

# 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a). However, LLMs sometimes generate fluent, instruction-compliant yet untruthful responses, commonly referred to as “hallucinations” (Ji et al., 2023). This phenomenon significantly undermines the credibility of LLMs in applications. Mitigating hallucinations of LLMs poses a substantial challenge, as hallucinations may stem from various factors, such as blindly following instructions, noisy data, lack of knowledge and the generation process (Zhang et al., 2023c).

Figure 1: A case to show that TruthX can control LLM to generate truthful or hallucinatory coherent responses via editing one vector in LLM’s internal representations.

Preceding such factors, a more fundamental issue is: whether LLMs can consistently generate truthful responses, even when they possess the correct knowledge? Recent researches suggest “no” for this question. For instance, Wei et al. (2022) found that LLMs can generate truthful responses in some contexts while producing hallucinations in others. Kadavath et al. (2022) and Dhuliawala et al. (2023) discovered that LLMs can identify the presence of hallucinations generated by themselves through self-validation. Saunders et al. (2022) directly pointed out the existence of the generationdiscrimination gap in LLMs. All these findings indicate that LLMs, even equipped with correct knowledge, are still susceptible to producing hallucinations during the generation process. Further, some works found a correlation between the

LLMs’ internal representations and the truthfulness of outputs (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Zhao et al., 2024), where some erroneous activations of internal representations lead LLMs to generate hallucinations even when they know the correct knowledge (Li et al., 2023b; Zou et al., 2023). Therefore, activating a well-trained LLM to generate truthful responses is the crucial first step in alleviating the hallucination of LLMs.

To this end, we propose TruthX, a truthfulness enhancement approach by editing LLM’s internal representations in the truthful space. To edit LLM in the truthful space without compromising its generative capabilities, TruthX decouples the LLM’s internal representations into truthful and semantic latent spaces respectively using an autoencoder. Then, TruthX employs contrastive learning to probe representations (Alain and Bengio, 2017; Belinkov, 2022) with similar semantics but opposite truthfulness and those with similar truthfulness but different semantics within these two latent spaces. During inference, TruthX effectively regulates the truthfulness of LLM by editing it in the truthful space, while ensuring that the generation capability remains intact. Figure 1 illustrates an example of TruthX controlling LLM to generate either truthful or hallucinatory coherent responses.

Experimental results show that TruthX enhances the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs, including Llama, Mistral, Baichuan and Chatglm, by an average of $20 \%$ on TruthfulQA benchmark. Through further analyses, we get the following findings:

• TruthX exhibits superiority in truthfulness control. Editing LLMs along the truthful direction can enhance the truthfulness of responses, conversely, editing LLMs along the opposite direction yields highly hallucinatory responses.

• The truthful space extracted from homologous LLMs (i.e., trained sequentially) exhibits a high degree of similarity, so we can directly adopt a well-trained TruthX to different homologous models for truthfulness enhancement.

• Layer-wise analysis indicates that the representations in middle layers of LLMs exhibit a higher correlation with the truthfulness of responses.

# 2 Related Work

Recent efforts aim to enhance LLM’s truthfulness during inference, falling into contrast decoding and representation editing. Contrast decoding modifies output probabilities based on comparisons between strong/weak models (Li et al., 2023c). By using a weak model with illusions, contrast decoding can improve the truthfulness of LLM (Chuang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Kai et al., 2024).

Representation editing has garnered increasing attention due to its controllability and lightweight properties. Early studies have demonstrated that tasks such as style transfer (Subramani et al., 2022; Hernandez et al., 2023) and controllable text generation (Dathathri et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022) can be achieved by editing model representations. Recently, Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023) finds truthful directions using paired internal activations. Inference-time Intervention (ITI) (Li et al., 2023b) probes and adjusts truthfulness within the attention heads of LLM. Expanding on ITI, Truth Forest (TrFr) (Chen et al., 2024) incorporates orthogonal constraints to refine probing capabilities. While ITI and Trfr have shown promising results, only editing attention heads for minimal interference to the generative capabilities (Brown et al., 2023; Hase et al., 2023) limits their enhancement of LLM’s truthfulness (Li et al., 2023b), as FFN module is always considered a knowledge memory (Geva et al., 2021; Hernandez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a). To this end, we propose TruthX, which focuses on all internal representations of LLM rather than solely on attention heads. Furthermore, TruthX probes and edits in the truthful space, thereby demonstrating more effective truthfulness enhancement and greater editing flexibility.

# 3 TruthX

To activate the truthfulness of a well-trained LLM, we introduce TruthX to edit its internal representations in truthful space. Figure 2 illustrates the diagram of TruthX.

# 3.1 Extracting Internal Representations

Most LLMs typically consist of stacked Transformer blocks, where each block comprises an attention module and a feed-forward neural network (FFN) module interconnected by residual connections (Vaswani et al., 2017). As depicted in Figure 2(a), the generation of the next token in an LLM can be conceptualized as the residual connections serving as the main stream, while the attention and FFN modules extract information from the contexts and parameters and add them to the residual stream (Meng et al., 2022). Naturally, hallucinations should logically originate from the representations generated by these attention (Li et al., 2023b) and FFN modules (Geva et al., 2021, 2022). Therefore, we aim to probe these internal representations.

![](images/a14bfe84b233ed0b90a66fec3edc37993a6417a32c7b1d5cf26fdb7608d18d7a.jpg)  
Figure 2: The schematic diagram of TruthX, which maps the LLM’s internal representations into truthful and semantic latent spaces, and then probes and edits the LLM in the truthful space, thereby enhancing its truthfulness.

To this end, we first stimulate LLM with both truthful and untruthful responses and extract its internal representations when generating content with opposite truthfulness. To do so, we construct triplets $\mathcal { D } = \{ ( Q , A ^ { p o s } , A ^ { n e g } ) \}$ , where $Q$ is the question, $A ^ { p o s }$ is a truthful answer, and $A ^ { n e g }$ is an untruthful answer. Given $\mathcal { D }$ , we stimulate LLM with either $Q + A ^ { p o s }$ or $Q + A ^ { n e g }$ to extract the corresponding internal representations.

To minimize the interference in probing caused by divergent token semantics, we only extract the internal representations of those tokens that appear simultaneously in both $A ^ { p o s }$ and $A ^ { n e g }$ , thereby ensuring maximal semantic similarity between representations. Formally, we extract the representations of the attention modules and FFN modules’ outputs in each layer when presented with truthful and untruthful stimuli, denoted as $X ^ { p o s } = \{ x ^ { p o s } \}$ and $X ^ { n e g } = \{ x ^ { n e g } \}$ , where $x ^ { p o s } , x ^ { n e g } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { m o d e l } }$ are the representations of the same token under truthful/untruthful stimuli, respectively, $d _ { m o d e l }$ is the dimension of the LLM’s hidden states.

# 3.2 Probing with Auto-Encoder

Given the internal representations of LLM, we map them to the truthful and semantic latent spaces using an auto-encoder. As depicted in Figure 2(b), the auto-encoder consists of a truthful encoder, a semantic encoder and a decoder, all implemented with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

Representation Reconstruction The primary objective of auto-encoder is to map LLM’s internal representation to different latent spaces via encoders, and then reconstruct itself through decoder (Wang et al., 2016). First, truthful encoder TruthEnc(·) and semantic encoder $\operatorname { S e m E n c } ( \cdot )$ map the internal representations $x \in \{ X ^ { p o s } , X ^ { n e g } \}$ to the truthful space and semantic space respectively:

$$
h _ { t r u t h } \mathrm { = } \mathrm { T r u t h E n c } ( x ) , h _ { s e m } \mathrm { = S e m E n c } ( x ) ,
$$

where $h _ { t r u t h } , h _ { s e m } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { l a t e n t } }$ are the latent representations in truthful and semantic space respectively, $d _ { l a t e n t }$ is the dimension of latent representations. Then, decoder $\mathrm { D e c } ( \cdot )$ reconstructs the LLM’s internal representations from the latent space representations, calculated as:

$$
\boldsymbol { x } ^ { ' } = \operatorname { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } + \mathrm { A t t n } \left( h _ { s e m } , h _ { t r u t h } \right) ) ,
$$

where $x ^ { ' }$ is the reconstructed representations, Attn is an attention operation from semantic latent representations (serving as query) to truthful latent representations (serving as key and value). The auto-encoder is optimized through the reconstruction loss $\mathcal { L } _ { \mathit { r e c o n } }$ between $x ^ { ' }$ and $x$ , calculated as:

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { r e c o n } = \mathrm { M S E } ( x , x ^ { ' } ) ,
$$

where $\mathrm { M S E ( \cdot ) }$ is mean square error loss function.

Contrastive Learning To encourage the truthful and semantic spaces to capture truthful and semantic features respectively, we employ contrastive learning on the latent representation within these two spaces. Specifically, our purpose is to create a clear demarcation between truthful and untruthful samples within the truthful space, and between samples with different semantics within the semantic space. Contrastive learning is a common technique used to achieve this goal (Sohn, 2016). Here, we first provide the general objective of contrastive learning. For a representation $s$ in the space, we construct a set of samples $S ^ { + }$ with the same class and a set of samples $S ^ { - }$ from different classes. Contrastive learning aligns representations in the space by minimizing the distance between $s$ and $S ^ { + }$ while maximizing the distance between $s$ and $S ^ { - }$ , where the training objective is calculated as:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathrm { C T R } ( s , S ^ { + } , S ^ { - } ) = } \\ & { - \log \frac { \sum _ { s ^ { \prime } \in S ^ { + } } \exp ( s i m ( s , s ^ { \prime } / \tau ) } { \sum _ { s ^ { \prime } \in ( S ^ { + } , S ^ { - } ) } \exp \left( s i m \left( s , s ^ { \prime } \right) / \tau \right) } . } \end{array}
$$

$s i m ( \cdot , \cdot )$ refers to cosine similarity between representations, and $\tau = 0 . 1$ is the temperature.

Since contrastive learning is employed on the entire dataset (Tian et al., 2020), we denote the set composed of latent representations in truthful space of all positive samples $x ^ { p o s } \in X ^ { p o s }$ a s Hpos and those of negative samples $x ^ { p o s } \in X ^ { n e g }$ as $H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ . Similarly, the set composed of semantic latent representations of all positive and negative samples are denoted as $H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ and $H _ { s e m } ^ { n e g }$ respectively.

In the truthful space, the latent representations of truthful and untruthful samples should be differentiated. Therefore, for a given sample $h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ , those samples sharing the same truthfulness Hpostrut form $S ^ { + }$ , while those with opposite truthfulness $H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ form $S ^ { - }$ . The contrastive learning is:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { L } _ { t r u t h } = \mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) } \\ { + \mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } , H _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) . } \end{array}
$$

In the semantic space, the latent representations of samples with different token meanings shodifferentiated. Therefore, for a given sample $h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ its corresponding $h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g }$ from the same token but opposite truthfulness form $S ^ { + }$ , while those representations with the same truthfulness but different meaning form $S ^ { - }$ . The contrastive learning is:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { L } _ { s e m } = \mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } , h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } , H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } \setminus h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } ) } \\ { + \mathrm { C T R } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } , h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } , H _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } \setminus h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } ) , } \end{array}
$$

where $H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } \setminus h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ represents removing the element $h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ from the set $H _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ . Totally, the contrastive learning in two spaces is calculated as:

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { c t r } = \mathcal { L } _ { t r u t h } + \mathcal { L } _ { s e m } .
$$

Owing to the introduced contrastive learning, truthful space captures truthful features and can probe truth/untruth representations, while the semantic space captures semantic features.

Truthfulness Editing After mapping the internal representations of LLM into the truthful and semantic space, TruthX aims to edit the latent representations in the truthful space and reconstruct the corresponding representations. To enhance TruthX’s ability to reconstruct from edited latent representations, we introduce an editing loss. Specifically, for a pair of $( x ^ { p o s } , x ^ { n e g } )$ with opposite truthfulness, we exchange their latent representations in the truthful space $h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } \Leftrightarrow h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ and reconstruct $( x ^ { n e g } , x ^ { p o s } )$ respectively via the decoder, represented as:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { x ^ { p o s  n e g } { = } \mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } { + } \mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s } , h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) ) , } \\ { x ^ { n e g  p o s } { = } \mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } { + } \mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } ^ { n e g } , h _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) ) . } \end{array}
$$

$x ^ { p o s  n e g }$ is reconstructed from $h _ { s e m } ^ { p o s }$ and $h _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ i.e., altering truthfulness from positive to negative, so the reconstructed representation is expected to be close to $x ^ { n e g }$ . Similarly, $x ^ { n e g  p o s }$ should be close to $x ^ { p o s }$ . Therefore, the editing loss $\mathcal { L } _ { e d i t }$ is:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { L } _ { e d i t } = \mathrm { M S E } ( x ^ { n e g } , x ^ { p o s \to n e g } ) } \\ { + \mathrm { M S E } ( x ^ { p o s } , x ^ { n e g \to p o s } ) . } \end{array}
$$

With editing loss, TruthX can adjust the truthfulness by editing the latent representations in the truthful space. Totally, the training objective $\mathcal { L }$ of TruthX consists of reconstruction loss, contrastive learning and editing loss:

$$
\mathcal { L } = \mathcal { L } _ { r e c o n } + \mathcal { L } _ { c t r } + \mathcal { L } _ { e d i t } .
$$

After training, truthful and untruthful representations exhibit distinct distributions in the truthful space. We aim to identify a truthful editing direction within this space, which points from the center of untruthful representations to the center of truthful representations. Formally, the truthful editing direction $\delta \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { l a t e n t } }$ is calculated as:

$$
\delta = \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } - \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ,
$$

wher e Hpos truth an d Hneg truth are the average representations in truthful space of all truthful samples and untruthful samples in the entire dataset.

# 3.3 Editing in Truthful Space

During inference, TruthX maps internal representations $x$ within LLM into truthful spaces $h _ { t r u t h }$ and semantic spaces $h _ { s e m }$ , and then edits the latent representations $h _ { t r u t h }$ in the truthful space, thereby enhancing the truthfulness of LLM. Specifically, given the trained edit direction $\delta \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { l a t e n t } }$ in truthful space, TruthX converts it to the editing direction $\Delta \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d _ { m o d e l } }$ within the representation space of $x$

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \Delta = \mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } + \mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } , h _ { t r u t h } + \delta ) ) } \\ { - \mathrm { D e c } ( h _ { s e m } + \mathrm { A t t n } ( h _ { s e m } , h _ { t r u t h } - \delta ) ) . } \end{array}
$$

Then, TruthX edits the internal representations $x$ along direction $\Delta$ :

$$
{ \hat { x } } = x + \alpha \times \Delta ,
$$

where $\alpha$ is a scalar of editing strength. Finally, TruthX puts the representation $\hat { x }$ back to LLM. In practice, TruthX edits the LLM’s internal representations on the selected top $k$ layers from all attention and FFN layers based on the probing accuracy of each layer on the validation set. For instance, for a 32-layer LLM and $k = 1 0$ , TruthX selects the top 10 modules with the highest probing accuracy out of the total 64 modules (32 attention modules $^ +$ 32 FFN modules) to edit LLM.

# 4 Experiments

# 4.1 Datasets

We conduct experiments on the TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, TriviaQA and FACTOR (news, expert, wiki) benchmarks.

TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) is the most widely used benchmark for assessing LLMs’ truthfulness, comprising 817 questions across 38 categories. TruthfulQA encompasses two tasks: multiplechoice and open-ended generation. In multiplechoice task, LLM selects an answer from multiple correct/incorrect options, evaluated through multiple-choice accuracy (MC1, MC2 and MC3). In open-ended generation task, LLM directly generates the answer. Following the standard procedure on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), we employ two fine-tuned GPT-3 models to judge whether the answer is truthful and informative, denoted as True $( \% )$ and Info $( \% )$ respectively, while the product True\*Info $( \% )$ serves as the primary metric. The calculations of metrics are reported in Appendix C.

Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), FACTOR (news, expert, wiki) (Muhlgay et al., 2023) are benchmarks for question answering, reading comprehension and factuality evaluation. We directly employ the well-trained TruthX model (trained on TruthfulQA data) on these benchmarks to assess TruthX’s outof-distribution generalizability. Following Li et al. (2023b) and Chuang et al. (2023), all benchmarks are presented in a multiple-choice format and evaluated the choosing accuracy in closed-book setting.

# 4.2 Baselines

We compare TruthX with the following methods.

Baseline The original Llama-2-7B-Chat model (Touvron et al., 2023b).

Supervised Finetuning Following Li et al. (2023b), the model is supervised finetuned on truthful QA pairs and Open Web Text.

Contrastive Decoding We involve CD (Li et al., 2023c), DoLa (Chuang et al., 2023), SH2 (Kai et al., 2024) and ICD (Zhang et al., 2023b), which respectively enhance the truthfulness of LLM by applying contrastive decoding on the output probabilities of strong/weak models, different layer outputs, different tokens, and truthful/illusion models.

Representation Editing The state-of-the-art methods for enhancing LLM’s truthfulness through editing internal representations, including ContrastConsistent Search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023), Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) (Li et al., 2023b), and Truth Forest (TrFr) (Chen et al., 2024), all learn a direction within attention heads and accordingly edit attention patterns of LLM.

TruthX The proposed method.

All methods apply the standard settings of TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022). The results of contrastive decoding methods are derived from replications of Kai et al. (2024) and (Zhang et al., 2023b). The results of ITI and TrFr are our replications based on their publicly-available models and outputs.

Configuration In TruthX, the truthful encoder and semantic encoder consist of 2-layer MLPs with dimensions $[ 4 0 9 6 \to 2 0 4 8$ , $2 0 4 8  1 0 2 4 ]$ , and the decoder consists of 2-layer MLPs with dimensions [ $1 0 2 4 \to 2 0 4 8$ , $2 0 4 8 \to 4 0 9 6 $ ]. The specific structure is presented in Appendix A. Following Li et al. (2023b) and Chen et al. (2024), we employ a 2-fold validation on TruthfulQA to ensure no overlap between training and testing. For training, TruthX is optimized using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. Based on the performance on validation set, we set the number of editing layers $k = 1 0$ and the editing strength $\alpha { = } 1 . 0$ and $\alpha { = } 4 . 5$ for the open-ended generation and multiple-choice task.

# 4.3 Main Results

Results on TruthfulQA Table 1 presents the comparison between TruthX and previous methods on TruthfulQA, where TruthX achieves the best results in both open-ended generation and multiplechoice tasks, yielding about $33 \%$ and $20 \%$ improvements over Llama-2-7B-Chat in True\*Info score and MC1, respectively. Compared to contrastive decoding methods, TruthX directly enhances truthfulness within the internal representations during decoding and does not require extra models or decoding twice (Zhang et al., 2023b), thereby improving truthfulness in a more efficient way.

Compared to the state-of-the-art ITI and TrFr, TruthX demonstrates significant advantages, primarily stemming from two reasons. First, different from ITI and TrFr intervening in attention heads to enhance truthfulness in attention patterns, TruthX edits the internal representations from attention and FFN modules, thereby enhancing truthfulness more comprehensively (Geva et al., 2021). Besides, intervening attention pattern often leads to noninformative responses like “I have no comment.” (187/817 for ITI, 144/817 for TrFr), thereby reducing the informativeness (Info $\%$ ) (Li et al., 2023b). TruthX does not exhibit this tendency (only 87/817 for TruthX), instead, TruthX always produces more rigorous responses, thereby achieving even higher informativeness $( 8 9 . 7 2 \% )$ compared to the baseline. Second, rather than directly edit the representations of LLM, TruthX maps them to semantic and truthful spaces and performs editing in the truthful space, thereby averting the impact on generation ability. This allows TruthX to perform stronger editing across more layers of LLM, thereby achieving a more significant enhancement.

Generalizability across more Benchmarks Table 2 illustrates TruthX’s performance across more benchmarks, where we directly use the TruthX model trained on TruthfulQA to assess its out-of-distribution generalization. The results indicate that TruthX does not disrupt the LLM’s performance when transferred to entirely new domains, and in some domains with strong relevance to real-world truthfulness (such as Natural Questions and FACTOR-news), TruthX even achieves some improvements. TruthX exhibits stronger generalization among various domains, primarily due to editing LLM only in truthful space without compromising their semantics and generative ability.

# 4.4 Results on More LLMs

To validate the effectiveness across various LLMs, we apply TruthX to 13 advanced LLMs and show the improvements on TruthfulQA benchmark in Figure 3. For LLMs of different sizes such as Llama-2-7B-Chat (hidden dim is 4096) and Llama2-13B-Chat (hidden dim is 5120), TruthX consistently enhances the truthfulness. When applied to different LLMs, TruthX enhances all their truthfulness, yielding average improvements of $20 \%$ in True\*Info score and $15 \%$ in MC1 accuracy. This highlights the versatility of TruthX across different LLMs. Promisingly, TruthX can elevate the MC1 of most 7B LLMs to surpass that of ChatGPT, approaching the level of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023).

We conduct extensive analyses to investigate the specific improvements of TruthX. Unless otherwise specified, all results are reported on TruthfulQA benchmark with Llama-2-7B-Chat as the baseline.

# 5.1 Ablation Study

In Table 3, we conduct the ablation study on the data construction, architecture and training objectives involved in TruthX, showing the effectiveness of each module. Specifically, the proposed contrastive learning $\mathcal { L } _ { c t r }$ plays a crucial role in TruthX for probing truthful/untruthful representations in

truthful space. For data construction, using those tokens that appear in both truthful/untruthful answers mitigates the interference in probe learning caused by divergent semantics. Furthermore, modeling semantic and truthful latent representations separately and merging them through attention operation also demonstrates effectiveness.

# 5.2 Superiority of Editing in Truthful Space

Truthfulness Direction To ascertain whether TruthX learns reasonable truthfulness direction $\delta$ in truthful space, we compare the effects of editing LLM along different directions in Table 4. The results indicate that editing within the semantic space does not influence LLM’s truthfulness, while editing in truthful space directly determines truthfulness, where editing with $\delta$ brings $20 \%$ MC1 improvements and editing with $- \delta$ results in a $19 \%$ MC1 drop. Moreover, ‘Random $\delta ^ { \ast }$ and ‘Orthogonal $\delta ^ { \bullet }$ have negligible effect on truthfulness, suggesting that TruthX indeed identifies a direction for truthfulness in the truthful space. Table 5 gives examples of editing with $\pm \delta$ , demonstrating TruthX’s capability to control the truthfulness of LLM.

Influence on Generative Capability To further explore the impact of editing in truthful/semantic space on LLM’s generative capabilities, we assess the perplexity (PPL) of the generated outputs using Llama-2-Chat in Figure 4. Naturally, Llama-2-Chat’s generation results evaluated by itself yield the lowest PPL. Compared to editing in truthful space, editing in semantic space resulted in numerous outliers with significantly higher PPL (generating repetitive or anomalous tokens), which adversely affect the generative capability (Brown et al., 2023). This observation suggests that the semantic space captures more features relevant to semantics and generative capability. Owing to decoupling the truthful and semantic spaces, TruthX fulfills our motivation of enhancing truthfulness without damaging generative capability of LLM.

Visualization of Latent Spaces For a more intuitive depiction of the truthful and semantic spaces in TruthX, we reduce the latent representations of samples $X ^ { p o s }$ and $X ^ { n e g }$ from the validation set to 2 dimensions using t-SNE and visualize their kernel density estimate distributions in Figure 5. Truthful and untruthful samples exhibit similar distributions in semantic space, while they are distinctly separated in truthful space, which indicates that TruthX can effectively probe the truthfulness of representations in truthful spaces, further editing truthfulness.

# 5.3 Effect of Editing Layers and Strength

Table 6 reports the generation performance of editing the LLM at different numbers of layers $( k )$ and strengths $\alpha$ . As the number of edited layers and the editing strength increase, TruthX progressively enhances the truthfulness of the LLM’s outputs.

The color (values in parentheses) indicates the improvement compared to the baseline. LLMs labeled with the same superscript are homologous.

# 5.4 Generalizability of Truthful Space among LLMs

To assess the feasibility of directly applying the TruthX model trained on one LLM to other LLMs, we evaluate the cross-LLM generalization of the TruthX model, as illustrated in Figure 6. The LLMs utilized in our investigation have approximately 7 billion parameters, with the same internal representation dimensions of 4096.

Our findings reveal that TruthX demonstrates robust generalization across homologous LLMs, i.e., those models trained sequentially with different stages or additional data. Specifically, Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), fine-tuned from Llama-1 (Touvron et al., 2023a), exhibits strong TruthX generalization akin to Llama-1. Similarly, Llama-2- Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b) and Vicuna-v1.5 (Chiang et al., 2023) are progressively fine-tuned from Llama-2, and TruthX can be directly applied across these three models to enhance truthfulness. The same phenomenon also occurs in Mistral, Baichuan and Chatglm. This observation suggests that the truthful space learned by TruthX and the direction of truthfulness editing are predominantly determined by the pre-training stage, with subsequent fine-tuning exerting minimal impact due to the relatively limited amount of training data. Efficiently, if a model is fine-tuned from Llama-2-Chat, TruthX trained on Llama-2-Chat can be directly used to (b) TruthfulQA MC1 accuracy of editing only one attention or FFN module.

improve its truthfulness without extra training.

# 5.5 Probing Accuracy across Layers

To explore the truthfulness across layers within LLM, we compute the probing accuracy (refer to Eq.(15)) of TruthX at each layer in the validation set and MC1 score when editing each individual layer. As depicted in Figure 7, we observe that the LLMs after alignments (Ouyang et al., 2022), exhibit higher probing accuracy compared to those LLMs without alignments such as Llama-1 (Touvron et al., 2023a) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). This suggests that the truthfulness in representations after alignment is more discernible by TruthX. Besides, among 32 layers, intermediate layers (10- 20) demonstrate higher probing accuracy and MC1 improvements, indicating a stronger correlation with truthfulness, which is consistent with previous findings (Li et al., 2023b; Geva et al., 2021). Besides, we find that the probing accuracy of attention and FFN is comparable, further affirming the motivation that TruthX probes all internal representations instead of only attention or FFN. Overall, TruthX achieves approximately $90 \%$ probing accuracy at some layers, highlighting its effectiveness.

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose TruthX, which enhances truthfulness by editing LLM in truthful space. We do not claim that TruthX guarantees LLMs will consistently generate truthful responses; rather, it aims to elicit LLMs to produce responses more truthfully. Promising results demonstrate that TruthX is a step towards truthfulness in the field of LLMs.

# Limitations

TruthX enhances the truthfulness of LLM by editing its internal representation in the truthful space. The motivation of TruthX is to elicit truthfulness in a well-trained LLM, encouraging it to generate outputs that faithfully reflect its learned world knowledge. TruthX does not possess the capability to create new knowledge out of thin air and inject it into LLM, thus exhibiting limitations in cases where the required knowledge lies beyond the scope of LLM training stages. Therefore, the potential of TruthX lies in collaborating with external knowledge to collectively mitigate the hallucinations of LLM from both internal and external perspectives. We leave this to future work, further advancing towards reliable LLMs.

Figure 8: Category-wise improvements of TruthX on TruthfulQA open-ended generation.

# A Configuration of TruthX

In this section, we give details of the TruthX architecture and training.

Architecture In TruthX, the auto-encoder architecture comprises a truthful encoder, a semantic encoder and a decoder, each composed of 2-layer MLPs followed by ReLU activation functions. The truthful and semantic encoders map the input representation $x$ into a latent representation. The first layer maps $x$ to a 2048-dimensional representation, and the second layer further reduces it to a 1024- dimensional latent representation. Subsequently, the truthful and semantic latent representations are fused according to Eq.(2). Finally, the decoder’s first layer maps the fused 1024-dimensional latent representation back to 2048 dimensions, and then restores it to the same dimensions as $x$ .

Training Following Li et al. (2023b) and Chen et al. (2024), we employ a 2-fold validation on TruthfulQA benchmark. Specifically, half of the questions (408 samples) with one correct and one incorrect response are allocated for training and validation of TruthX, while the remaining half is used for testing. The training and validation sets are randomly split in a 3:1 ratio.

# B Expanded Analyses

# B.1 Category-wise Improvements of TruthX

Figure 8 illustrates the specific improvements achieved by TruthX across the 38 hallucination categories covered in TruthfulQA benchmark. TruthX

consistently enhances the truthfulness of LLM across all types of questions.

# B.2 Dimensions of Latent Space

To explore the performance of TruthX with latent representations of varying dimensions, we present the results on TruthfulQA using different dimensions of latent representations in Table 7. The findings demonstrate that latent representations spanning from 64 to 2048 dimensions all contribute to enhancing the truthfulness of LLMs through editing within the truthful space. Specifically, when the latent representations decrease to 64 dimensions, a slight decrease in TruthX performance is observed, primarily manifested in a drop in informativeness (resulting in more occurrences of “I have no comment.”, 147 of 817). This suggests that higher-dimensional latent representations empower TruthX to execute more nuanced editing within the truthful space, rather than simply resorting to a uniform “I have no comment.”.

# B.3 Data Size for TruthX Training

To analyze the impact of training data size on TruthX, we present the performance of TruthX on TruthfulQA open-ended generation tasks under various training data size conditions, as depicted in Figure 9. Specifically, we vary the total data size used for training and validation from $50 \%$ (i.e., 408 samples) down to $5 \%$ (i.e., 40 samples), while maintaining a consistent 3:1 split between training and validation sets. The results reveal a slight decrease in TruthX performance as the data size decreases. Importantly, even with only $5 \%$ of the data, corresponding to 40 samples for training and validation (30 samples for training and 10 samples for validation), TruthX can elevate the True\*Info $( \% )$ of Llama-2-7B-Chat from $3 1 . 9 0 \%$ to $6 3 . 7 7 \%$ showcasing the lightweight and practical advantages of TruthX.

Table 7: Performance of TruthX with different dimensions of latent representations on TruthfulQA benchmark. We employ truthful and semantic encoders of varying sizes to map the internal representations of LLMs to latent representations of different dimensions. The decoder utilizes a dimension mapping that is the reverse of the encoder.

# B.4 Visualization of Probing on Internal Representations

In Figures 10 and 11, we visualize the internal representations of the LLM probed by TruthX. Specifically, TruthX maps the internal representations $x$ of LLM to the truthful space $h _ { t r u t h }$ and calculates the distance between $h _ { t r u t h }$ and the center of truthful representations $\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ , subtracting the distance between them and the center of untruthful representations H truth $( \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ and $\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ refer to Eq.(12)). Formally, the probing of internal representations $x$ in truthful space is expressed as:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathrm { P r o b e } \left( \boldsymbol { x } \right) = p o s , } \\ & { \qquad \mathrm { i f } \ s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) \geq s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) } \\ & { \mathrm { P r o b e } \left( \boldsymbol { x } \right) = n e g , } \\ & { \qquad \mathrm { i f } \ s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s } ) < s i m ( h _ { t r u t h } , \overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g } ) } \end{array}
$$

where $s i m ( \cdot , \cdot )$ is cosine similarity, $h _ { t r u t h } ~ =$ TruthEnc $( x )$ is the latent representations of $x$ in truthful space.

As shown in Figures 10 and 11, TruthX effectively probes the internal representations of LLM in the truthful space, where the latent representations of truthful answers tend to be closer to $\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { p o s }$ while those of untruthful answers are closer to $\overline { { H } } _ { t r u t h } ^ { n e g }$ . Particularly in the case of Figure 10, when LLM generates the incorrect token “language”, its internal representation is the most illusionary. Similarly, in Figure 11, after generating “Low calorie”, due to the constraints of autoregressive generation, LLM can only continue to “fabricate” the following content, resulting in the entire generation process being filled with illusions. Overall, TruthX demonstrates effective probing of truthfulness within the truthful space.

# C Evaluation of TruthfulQA

TruthfulQA is a benchmark specifically designed to entice the model to produce hallucinatory answers. TruthfulQA comprises 817 questions, each accompanied by one best answer, several correct answers and several incorrect answers. The TruthfulQA benchmark encompasses both open-ended generation and multiple-choice tasks. Below, we will introduce the two tasks and their corresponding metrics.

Open-ended Generation The model generates responses to questions directly using greedy decoding. Following the standard practice on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Chen et al., (a) Truthful answer: People cannot learn in their sleep.

Figure 10: Visualization of probing LLM’s internal representations, showing case 602 in TruthfulQA benckmark. Question: We now have scientific evidence that some people can learn what in their sleep?. We illustrate the process of an LLM generating the next token, where the vertical axis from top to bottom represents the internal representations from the attention and FFN modules from the 1st layer to the 32nd layer. The tokens inside the boxes represent the tokens decoded from the current internal representation using the final lm_head of the LLM. The colors denote the probing results in the truthful space, with blue indicating proximity to the center of truthful representations and red indicating proximity to the center of untruthful representations.

2024), we utilize two fine-tuned GPT-3 models, namely “GPT-judge” and “GPT-info”, to assess the truthfulness and informativeness of the responses, i.e., performing binary classification on the truthfulness and informativeness of the response. The metrics for open-ended generation tasks include True $( \% )$ , Info $( \% )$ and True\*Info $( \% )$ which are calculated as:

• True $( \% )$ : the percentage of responses that are deemed truthful.   
• Info $( \% )$ : the percentage of responses that provide helpful information. Responses lacking substantive meaning, such as $^ { 6 6 } I$ have no comment.”, are classified as lacking informativeness.   
• True\*Info $( \% )$ : the product of True $( \% )$ and Info $( \% )$ , serving as a comprehensive measure for evaluating the truthfulness and informativeness of model responses.

Multiple-choice The model selects an answer from multiple correct and incorrect options by comparing the conditional probabilities of candidate options given the question. Multiple-choice task is evaluated through multiple-choice accuracy (MC), which involves MC1, MC2 and MC3, calculated as:

• MC1 $( \% )$ : the proportion of instances where the model assigns the highest probabilities to the best answer.   
• MC2 $( \% )$ : the proportion of instances where the normalized probability mass for all correct answers is greater than that of the incorrect answers.   
• MC3 $( \% )$ the proportion of instances where all correct answers receive higher scores than all incorrect answers, i.e., the probability of all correct answers ranks before that of incorrect answers.

Following the Standard setting from Lin et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2023b), we apply the few-shot prompting for TruthfulQA, the few-shot prompting are:
