# EP2C Paper Repository

This repository stores academic papers that will be used to fine-tune language models (LLMs) in the EP2C (Explainable Paper-to-Code) project. The papers are selected based on the availability of corresponding code repositories or publicly available datasets. These papers will help build a comprehensive dataset for training our models to generate runnable code from academic papers.



## Purpose

This folder contains papers and their corresponding code repositories, which will be used to:

1. Fine-tune language models (e.g., CodeLlama, StarCoder).
2. Enable the generation of code based on paper content.
3. Train models to automatically identify missing elements (datasets, hyperparameters, etc.) and link them to the generated code.
