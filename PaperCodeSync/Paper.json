    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes suffer from producing hallucinations, especially LLMs may generate untruthful responses despite knowing the correct knowledge. Activating the truthfulness within LLM is the key to fully unlocking LLM's knowledge potential. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inference-time intervention method to activate the truthfulness of LLM by identifying and editing the features within LLM's internal representations that govern the truthfulness. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM's representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM's internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLM. Experiments show that TruthX improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of 20% on Truth-fulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that TruthX can control LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses via editing only one vector in LLM's internal representations 1 .",

Recent researches suggest \"no\" for this question. For instance, Wei et al. (2022) found that LLMs can generate truthful responses in some contexts while producing hallucinations in others. Kadavath et al. (2022) and Dhuliawala et al. (2023) discovered that LLMs can identify the presence of hallucinations generated by themselves through self-validation. Saunders et al. (2022) directly pointed out the existence of the generationdiscrimination gap in LLMs. All these findings indicate that LLMs, even equipped with correct knowledge, are still susceptible to producing hallucinations during the generation process. Further, some works found a correlation between the LLMs' internal representations and the truthfulness of outputs (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023;Marks and Tegmark, 2023;Zhao et al., 2024), where some erroneous activations of internal representations lead LLMs to generate hallucinations even when they know the correct knowledge (Li et al., 2023b;Zou et al., 2023). Therefore, activating a well-trained LLM to generate truthful responses is the crucial first step in alleviating the hallucination of LLMs.",

Contrast decoding modifies output probabilities based on comparisons between strong/weak models (Li et al., 2023c). By using a weak model with illusions, contrast decoding can improve the truthfulness of LLM (Chuang et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023b;Kai et al., 2024). Representation editing has garnered increasing attention due to its controllability and lightweight properties. Early studies have demonstrated that tasks such as style transfer (Subramani et al., 2022;Hernandez et al., 2023) and controllable text generation (Dathathri et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2022) can be achieved by editing model representations. Recently, Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023) finds truthful directions using paired internal activations. Inference-time Intervention (ITI) (Li et al., 2023b) probes and adjusts truthfulness within the attention heads of LLM. Expanding on ITI, Truth Forest (TrFr) (Chen et al., 2024) incorporates orthogonal constraints to refine probing capabilities. While ITI and Trfr have shown promising results, only editing attention heads for minimal interference to the generative capabilities (Brown et al., 2023;Hase et al., 2023) limits their enhancement of LLM's truthfulness (Li et al., 2023b), as FFN module is always considered a knowledge memory (Geva et al., 2021;Hernandez et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023a). To this end, we propose TruthX, which focuses on all internal representations of LLM rather than solely on attention heads. Furthermore, TruthX probes and edits in the truthful space, thereby demonstrating more effective truthfulness enhancement and greater editing flexibility.",

First, different from ITI and TrFr intervening in attention heads to enhance truthfulness in attention patterns, TruthX edits the internal representations from attention and FFN modules, thereby enhancing truthfulness more comprehensively (Geva et al., 2021). Besides, intervening attention pattern often leads to noninformative responses like \"I have no comment.\" (187/817 for ITI, 144/817 for TrFr), thereby reducing the informativeness (Info %) (Li et al., 2023b). TruthX does not exhibit this tendency (only 87/817 for TruthX), instead, TruthX always produces more rigorous responses, thereby achieving even higher informativeness (89.72%) compared to the baseline. Second, rather than directly edit the representations of LLM, TruthX maps them to semantic and truthful spaces and performs editing in the truthful space, thereby averting the impact on generation ability.

Similarly, Llama-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b) and Vicuna-v1.5 (Chiang et al., 2023) are progressively fine-tuned from Llama-2, and TruthX can be directly applied across these three models to enhance truthfulness. The same phenomenon also occurs in Mistral, Baichuan and Chatglm. This observation suggests that the truthful space learned by TruthX and the direction of truthfulness editing are predominantly determined by the pre-training stage, with subsequent fine-tuning exerting minimal impact due to the relatively limited amount of training data.

This suggests that the truthfulness in representations after alignment is more discernible by TruthX. Besides, among 32 layers, intermediate layers (10-20) demonstrate higher probing accuracy and MC1 improvements, indicating a stronger correlation with truthfulness, which is consistent with previous findings (Li et al., 2023b;Geva et al., 2021).

          "text": "To analyze the impact of training data size on TruthX, we present the performance of TruthX on TruthfulQA open-ended generation tasks under various training data size conditions, as depicted in Figure 9. Specifically, we vary the total data size used for training and validation from 50% (i.e., 408 samples) down to 5% (i.e., 40 samples), while maintaining a consistent 3:1 split between training and validation sets. The results reveal a slight  decrease in TruthX performance as the data size decreases. Importantly, even with only 5% of the data, corresponding to 40 samples for training and validation (30 samples for training and 10 samples for validation), TruthX can elevate the True*Info (%) of Llama-2-7B-Chat from 31.90% to 63.77%, showcasing the lightweight and practical advantages of TruthX. B.4 Visualization of Probing on Internal Representations In Figures 10 and 11, we visualize the internal representations of the LLM probed by TruthX. Specifically, TruthX maps the internal representations x of LLM to the truthful space h truth and calculates the distance between h truth and the center of truthful representations H pos truth , subtracting the distance between them and the center of untruthful representations H neg truth (H pos truth and H neg truth refer to Eq.( 12)). Formally, the probing of internal representations x in truthful space is expressed as:",

Particularly in the case of Figure 10, when LLM generates the incorrect token \"language\", its internal representation is the most illusionary. Similarly, in Figure 11, after generating \"Low calorie\", due to the constraints of autoregressive generation, LLM can only continue to \"fabricate\" the following content, resulting in the entire generation process being filled with illusions. Overall, TruthX demonstrates effective probing of truthfulness within the truthful space.",
